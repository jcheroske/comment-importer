The ultrafine air pollution from the ship’s exhaust is a serious threat to me, as well as the health of both crew and passengers, as air pollution on the deck of cruise ships is worse than some of the world's most polluted cities.  Cruise ships should be required to shift to cleaner fuels and stronger filters to reduce ultrafine air pollution that can cause higher rates of asthma and cardiovascular disease which the CDC itself has indicated are associated with increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19.  The burning of dirty fuel generates large amounts of particulate matter and smog pollutants, so the populations in coastal and port communities are severly damaged: Shipping emissions have been shown to cause much higher rates of lung and cardiovascular disease, as well as childhood asthma. These impacts are dramatically enhanced as a result of identified risk of more severe health impacts associated with COVID-19 on those with these underlying medical conditions.  Cruise companies could easily switch their ships away from bottom-of-the-barrel oil to run on cleaner fuels but refuse to do so, putting profits over the health of their passengers and communities they travel to, just as they have done with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic. There have been multiple reports of crew and passengers testing positive for COVID-19 where cruise companies have started sailing again - it's just not safe.  I do not want damaged lungs and I do not want a damaged world.  We have to think of our planet.",,,

The ultrafine air pollution from the ship’s exhaust poses a serious threat to the health of both crew and passengers. And we have proof. Through our undercover investigation in collaboration with Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Stand.earth found that air pollution on the deck of cruise ships is worse than some of the world's most polluted cities.Other key points:•Cruise ships should be required to shift to cleaner fuels and stronger filters to reduce ultrafine air pollution that can cause higher rates of asthma and cardiovascular disease which the CDC itself has indicated are associated with increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19.•Cruise ships have been a major vector in the spread of COVID-19, and must be required to do more to protect passengers and staff both from exposure to the virus, and pollution that is likely to increase the health impacts of COVID-19.Other resources:•The CDC’s own article linking the above conditions.2. Cruise ships cannot come back until they start using cleaner fuels. By running on the dirtiest and cheapest fuel available, cruises put the health of not only the passengers and crew on board, but also the populations in coastal and port communities. How does fuel relate to health, you ask? The burning of dirty fuel generates large amounts of particulate matter and smog pollutants. So, it’s basically like traveling in a bubble of pollution, smog and disgusting air.Other key points:•Shipping emissions have been shown to cause much higher rates of lung and cardiovascular disease, as well as childhood asthma.

There is no reason I should be able to fly, stay in hotels, eat at restaurants, attend movies, go to water parks, go to amusement parks, etc.... and not be able to board a cruise ship. Tell me how any of this is fair?The cruise ship is one of the most clean/sanitized environments I have ever seen. It is around the clock cleaning, sanitizing, washing, etc. They are a self-contained unit that can control the environment as much as needed. They all fall under the VSP...does that not mean anything? I guess why have them follow a program if it doesn't really mean anything.... according to their website they accomplish their mission by.Inspecting cruise ships in periodic, unannounced operational sanitation inspections.Monitoring gastrointestinal illnesses and investigating or responding to outbreaks.Training cruise ship employees on public health practices.Providing health education and reliable and current public health information to the cruise ship industry, the traveling public, public health professionals, state and local health authorities, and the media.Above bullets are copied from (https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/desc/aboutvsp.htm)It is time for the general public to be able to make up their own minds.

The numbers have been grossly over blown & the dangers of this virus exaggerated. Yes, people may die from this virus, as they would from strep, viral pneumonia, heart attacks, strokes, flu & that is terribly sad but absolutely no reason to try prevent infection by isolating people. Of the HUGE number of deaths counted as Covid 19 caused only 6% were actually the cause. On average every other death had 2.6 other conditions that either contributed or were the actual cause of death. There is no reason to shut down the cruise industry or any other business or activity for that matter, for such low numbers. Viruses will come, they will mutate, they will run their course through society. Unfortunately, the sick may succumb & that is sad, but life ends with death. You cannot stop it.

The serving spoon handle should have a raised divider in between the spoon and the handle. The divider acts as a shield for the spoon and also as a physical stop for the hand. Guests are already required to wash hands or use hand sanitizer before entering the buffet line and yet viral and/or bacterial outbreaks continues. Having this serving spoon with a handle divider, hand washing before entering the buffet line, and educating guests on how to properly handle serving spoons should help to not spread the outbreak.

CDC-2020-0087-3191,2020-09-14T04:00:00Z,Anonymous,Anonymous,Comment from Anonymous,"Cruise Ships have been unfairly targeted during the pandemic and while they did have many outbreaks, looking back we can see that the reasons the outbreaks were serious was solely due to lack of knowledge about COVID-19 and the necessary precautions/remedies needed. We have come a long way from March and the death rate itself has come down significantly due to better therapeutics and processes. Due to the advances I strongly believe Cruise Ships should be allowed to resume sailing with proper processes in place to detect, prevent and contain the further spread of the virus. Cruise ships already have a very robust program and have the facility to handle breakouts of other viruses. On the many ships I’ve sailed on, every single ship required hand sanitization and hand washing prior to entering any buffet. With added hand sanitizers, mandatory temperature checks, updated filtration system and most importantly at least two quick tests like the FDA approved Abott test they should be able to contain any possible issues. I believe it also goes without saying that they should operate with a limited capacity (possibly capping cabins at 2 occupancy instead of the 4). It’s likely that many of the places cruises will visit already allow Americans to enter and therefore treating cruises different from Airlines is extremely biased since it’s much easier to operate socially distant on cruises than it is to operate on Airlines where you’re not more than 3-6 inches away from your neighbor. Should the necessity arise, it might even be plausible to rapid test each passenger as they disembark and reembark to ensure safety that way passengers aren’t handcuffed while vacationing.I don’t believe cruises should abandon voyages or completely shut things down in the event a case is detected, they have sufficient means to quarantine the infected and test the entire ship as well as trace contact between passengers to ensure that the remaining passengers are safe. The rapid tests can assist with this. However, if anyone is shown to be positive prior to the cruise starting they should not be allowed onboard. At the end of the day this virus is not going anywhere, even with a future vaccine, it is not logical to expect even 50% of the worlds population to be vaccinated in the near future. It may even be considered a violation of human rights to forcefully vaccinate or require vaccination for normal activities. So as long as proper precautions (testing, masks, sanitization) are taken I believe we can all live in a new normal without the disastrous impact on the economy of key Cruise regions like Florida, USVI, Puerto Rico and all the businesses that depend on this industry. Our limitations due to Covid have proven to be far more disastrous across the world from the economic shut down than from the actual virus itself and we need to begin the process to the new normal.

I've been on 2 cruises (pre COVID 19) and my specific cruise line (Royal Caribbean) was very attentive with health safety by having sanitation stations and quarantine with symptoms of an illness. I believe between those precautions, in addition to the revamped and additional guidelines cruising should be safe to continue. Other resorts and airlines get to resume and I think it's fair these business get to continue to sail and operate just like the resorts. In conclusion me and my family are looking to our cruise and feel very comfortable and safe going on board.  ",,,

This wave is visible by viewing the graph of worldwide active cases which shows the known active cases today are greater than every yesterday so far... meaning the Covid19 Corona virus is still spreading further. Even if the curve seems to be starting to flatten a bit now, that could easily be reversed into a steep increase again through irresponsible human actions/choices/policies. In knowledge of the fact that more spreaders are spreading it today than every yesterday makes the idea of allowing cruise ship operations in the near future absolutely illogical. What took months to climax likely will take months to subside again. Cruise Ship operations should not be considered until next year, or until every cabin is a fitting quarantine facility with no ventilation connections to any other cabins/parts of the ship, but only directly to outdoor air.Evidence has shown that AC and ventilation systems can transmit the pathogens to closed cabins, so currently, no safety is possible on a cruise ship. If just one passenger is infected, all others are also at risk of contracting it, so allowing such is a known cess pool and therefore a crime. The spread will not subside, but rise further if such an irresponsible act is committed as allowing cruise ship operations. Chronic effects of becoming a carrier of Covid19 coronavirus are mostly yet to be researched, and presuming the current-seen known acute illness that attacks a few victims is the only harm of becoming a carrier is absurd and irresponsible. Furthermore, mutations have come to light that are more harmful to youth and the work force. Those who survive and recover are still at risk of (many/mostly unknown so far) chronic sufferings that may permanently handicap them over time and force them out of their line of work.The only responsible choice is to not allow cruise ships for many, many more months, and keep the CDC policies in line with logic and up-to-date research findings. Failing to do so is nothing short of criminal and tragic. ",,,

Cruise ships have always gotten a bad rap for norovirus, etc.  Norovirus can be picked up in schools, hospitals, etc., but the media always finds the ships that are sick.The ships are cleaner than most places we visit . Theme parks have opened, casinos and restaurants, why not cruise ships.  COVID tests are not always available and ready by the time we sail as some of us fly into port early to avoid flight delays or to just enjoy a few days in port.  It would be awesome if you have tests available for those who are unable to test at home.  A vaccine may not every come to fruition. EVER. As adults let us make our own decision.  I think that mandating masks during embarkation and debarkation would be a great idea.  Anytime that we would be herded into one area.  I would think that they could/should be mandated during shows.  Buffets do not have to be self serve.  Perhaps in the beginning the surcharge restaurants could be complimentary to avoid overcrowding in restaurants.  Also shore excursions that have been approved by RC that will meet the standards and make the necessary cleaning for their guests.  QR scanning for menus at dining room.  Wearable/trackable bands that will provide contact tracing info.  Thats about all I can think of now.  We are anxious to cruise.  We have all had our hopes dashed.  Thanks for listening.",,,

The ultrafine air pollution from the ship’s exhaust poses a serious threat to the health of both crew and passengers. And we have proof. A Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health and Stand.earth found that air pollution on the deck of cruise ships is worse than some of the world's most polluted cities. (https://www.stand.earth/latest/protect-arctic/carnivals-cruise-pollution/investigation-air-quality-carnival-corp-cruise)Cruise ships should be required to shift to cleaner fuels and stronger filters to reduce ultrafine air pollution that can cause higher rates of asthma and cardiovascular disease which the CDC itself has indicated are associated with increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19.Cruise ships have been a major vector in the spread of COVID-19, and must be required to do more to protect passengers and staff both from exposure to the virus and pollution that is likely to increase the health impacts of COVID-19.Cruise ships run on the dirtiest and cheapest fuel available, which contributes to both climate change and negative impacts on the health of passengers and crew.Cruise ships cannot come back until they start using cleaner fuels. By running on the dirtiest and cheapest fuel available, cruises put the health of not only the passengers and crew on board, but also the populations in coastal and port communities. How does fuel relate to health, you ask? The burning of dirty fuel generates large amounts of particulate matter and smog pollutants. So, it’s basically like traveling in a bubble of pollution, smog and disgusting air.Shipping emissions have been shown to cause much higher rates of lung and cardiovascular disease, as well as childhood asthma. These impacts are dramatically enhanced as a result of identified risk of more severe health impacts associated with COVID-19 on those with these underlying medical conditions.Cruise companies could easily switch their ships away from bottom-of-the-barrel oil to run on cleaner fuels but refuse to do so, putting profits over the health of their passengers and communities they travel to, just as they have done concerning the COVID-19 pandemic.There have been multiple reports of crew and passengers testing positive for COVID-19 where cruise companies have started sailing again.Forty-one passengers and crew on a relatively small cruise ship in Norway tested positive for COVID-19. A crew member on a ship in the Pacific also tested positive for the virus. That’s two too many instances of the outbreak to approve the return of cruises.",,,

Just as Disney parks and a number of other theme parks have opened with safety measures in place.  It should now be the decision of the people if they feel they are ready to cruise.   CDC can put some rules in place to regulate the cruise industry.  With CDC regulations loosening up on land it's time to do the same at sea.  If a person gets COVID on a cruis, they could have a specific rooms set aside away from people to quarantine in and after they get back, there is no reason they couldn't drive directly home. Maybe a guideline is if you are cruising you must drive to the port, for the fact it would be safer to drive home and not expose anyone at the airport.  Once a guest tests positive it could require them to wear a mask in the quarantine room also.  So many things are open now in the travel field. People are staying at hotels, flying, camping, theme parks, restaurants and the list goes on.   I believe with strict COVID policy in hand, people are ready to cruise again.  We had two cruises canceled already and are scheduled to go November 21st.   I am hopeful that the cruise restriction will be up and my family can enjoy our trip that we have been waiting for.  Let the cruise companies show their protocols and you can also add what you feel is missing.  Maybe to start with cruises do not stop at any ports but are allowed to be at sea.

I have been cruising for over 50 years and have seen how the cruise lines have improved over that period of time.  Most all of the ships have improved air circulation and filtration.  Sanitation onboard has vastly improved with hand sanitizing stations throughout as well as cleanliness of the ships. Protection of our oceans is paramount for many of the lines.  Ships travel with medical facilities onboard - doctors and nurses.  All of this has taken place even before the Covid pandemic started.  With the current knowledge we have regarding Covid most cruise lines will have developed a plan to pre-screen passengers before boarding the ship.  The few instances of cruise ships and Covid 19 passengers started before there was any knowledge of this pandemic and passengers with illnesses boarded the ship.  I believe precautions are being implemented to safeguard this from happening again.  The CDC claims to be the experts in this matter.  They have developed a questionnaire with 28 questions that even they could not answer.  Looks like wanting a scapegoat is their main objective.  They have singled out this one industry.

For example, it appears that MSC is having success with testing and close monitoring of time ashore. Cruise ships can go out below capacity and enforce social distancing and mask policies much as restaurants do in the community. There also needs to be a protocol by which a positive test results in isolation without cancelation of the entire cruise. I believe the cruise lines, destinations, and public health authorities should be able to agree on protocols appropriate for a given timeframe. With these in place, the risk on a cruise ship should not be materially greater than other public places. I do not think society should permanently ban cruising because of missteps at the outset of this pandemic when all were just learning its basics. However, if individuals want to make such a judgment, they are free to do so. Just as others should be free to weigh the risks and choose to cruise if that is the right choice for them. ",,,

All your cruise lines have stepped up and are doing preventive actions in order to get back sailing.  I do believe they should be allowed back to the US unlike what we saw earlier in the year.

Companies like Sorrento Therapeutics offer a saliva-based rapid test that does not require a lab setting to provide results in less than 30min. It also does not require medial professionals to administer so the ship could designate crew to perform this task for everyone.A rapid saliva test would be crucial to feeling safer to reopening cruising. I foresee arriving at the terminal and having to take the rapid test. While I wait to embark, I would get my results that would be connected to my cruise app. This would ensure that everyone getting on the ship was covid free. I think that anytime someone steps foot off the ship they would be required to get a test before being allowed back on. The crew themselves should be tested daily, regardless of getting off or on the ship. This could be done very easily where saliva samples are all collected in the morning or evens based on assignments and then results would come back very quickly and they would receive it via an app as well.With the large number of tests being needed, the costs would be minimal because scale will help across the various cruise ships.",,,

In those years I have seen that natural remedies are effective in treating those syndromes. In this most recent Corona virus illness there have been allot of protocol used that probably were not needed and the patientprobably got better regardless of the treatment. I have observed however, that an effective treatment for the Corona Virus is by using; 50 mg's of zinc daily,Vitamin C 1000 mg's twice per day, with the Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg's daily, in conjunction with an anti-inflammatory such as aspirin, Aleve or ibuprofen (but for persons allergic to those, a steroid is effective). This is done for 5 days and has decreased the symptom and duration of this syndrome.A prophylactic treatment has been effective also with the hydroxychloroquine 200mg's twice per week. Good nutrition with antioxidants, works well. There is some evidence the Ivermectin 0.2 to 0.6 mg's per kilogram one or 2 doses may work both to prevent or treat the Covid-19 disease. A recommendation I would make to the Cruise industry is that they could have a prophylactic pre-cruise protocol: 1) each passenger should take 200 mg's of Hydroxychloroquine 24 hours prior to departure and a second dose 48 hours later.This for itineraries of up to 7 days, repeated if the itineraries is for longer periods. 2) the passenger should take Zinc 50 mg's daily with vitamin C 1000 mg's daily for the entire cruise. I believe that using this pre-cruise protocol would make it safe resume cruising under any circumstance. Of course the other safety measure that the Cruise industry has recommended wouldn't hurt.Another recommendation: Should there be passengers who become ill during the cruise and test positive for the Corona virus, should then be put on the above mentioned treatment. This should be started immediately, that cabin should be put on quarantine with the usual precautions. The ships doctors should have adequate doses of the medication to treat a 1/3 of the passengers and crew. Of course it would be a good idea if the passengers were to bring enough of there own medication to handle there own cabin occupants, should this happen.Thank you for allowing me to offer some advice.Dr. Horace R.

I am just a concerned citizen that regularly participates in cruise and non-cruise travel. II:  In my opinion, the cruise industry has been singled out compared with other similar industries.  As one example, I have flown several times during the Covid-19 epidemic.  How often are airport workers tested?  What are their protocols?  What about flight attendants and airline maintenance crews?  When a busy airport such as LAX handles in excess of 175,000 passengers per day, it is easy to see how Covid could easily be passed to 10's of thousands of people per day by a member of the TSA, a coffee shop worker or a gate agent, and spread nation-wide yet they are not held to the same scrutiny.  What about hotels, many of whom hold as many or more people than cruise ships?  Shopping malls?  Even workers at a local Costco could interact with thousands of people per day. III:  A cruise ship is a semi-contained environment where the exposure is primarily related to the number of guests and crew onboard whereas the above scenarios such as air travel represent the possibility of exponential daily infections with 10's of thousands of people if not more. IV:  With some additional and reasonable and cost-effective enhancements regarding Covid, I would consider a cruise vacation to be safer than a trip to San Francisco, New York or Las Vegas, much less a resort vacation in a foreign country. V:  Elimination of risk is both an unattainable and unrealistic objective.  The objective should be doing the best possible within reason of mitigating risk, not eliminating it.  During a pandemic, even leaving one's home is an acceptance of increased risk.  If I choose to go to a store and I contract Covid-19, should I hold the store liable if they had done their best to reduce (but not eliminate) risk of infection?  Some burden of responsibility of acceptance of risk should be placed on the passengers themselves. VI:  I have sailed on many cruise lines and I must say that Norwegian Cruise Line's handling of outbreaks such as Norovirus is exceptional.  Guest quarantines, buffet shutdowns and advanced sanitization methods all contribute to the safety of their guests.  Even under normal circumstances, NCL has crew members at each buffet entrance actively spraying guest's hands with sanitizers plus the voluntary inclusion of hand wash sinks at buffet entrances on their newer vessels all contribute to a low number of outbreaks and when it does occur, a lower than normal number of affected guests in terms of percentage.  NCL should be lauded for these types of measures. The norovirus is not the same as Covid-19 however, it does kill an estimated 200,000 people a year.  While NCL's voluntary, prophylactic approach has reduced the risk of guest and crew infections significantly, there is still no way to completely eliminate the possibility of norovirus infections.  Subsequently, it is not possible to eliminate the possibility of Covid infections, only a reduction of the risk. VII:  I encourage the CDC to be an active partner with the cruise lines in helping reduce the risk of infections while also accepting that zero risk is an impossibility.  Working together, solutions can be found that are both effective in minimizing risk but are also cost-effective so that the cruise industry can continue to thrive. VIII: Cruise lines and its passengers represent a significant financial windfall for ports, both in the US and in foreign countries.  Solving the Covid problem should not be borne solely by the cruise lines but shared across all who benefit including local and federal governments, and the shipping ports themselves.   IX: In addition, for public health and safety, the Passenger Vessels Service Act (PSVA) must be suspended.   This would allow cruise lines to offer a ""cruise to nowhere"" where there are zero ports of call and also to adjust itineraries based on the health and service infrastructure available in ports, skip ports with spikes in infections, etc.  A cruise to nowhere would present the greatest opportunity to reduce risk. X: The second biggest opportunity to reduce risk would be the elimination of the mandatory safety drills which by far is the single moment of greatest passenger and crew density of the entire cruise.  Replace these with printed instructions each of the guests must sign and / or video demonstrations.  ",,,
CDC-2020-0087-3216,2020-09-15T04:00:00Z,Anonymous,Anonymous,Comment from Anonymous,"Please bring back cruising! It's not right that amusement parks, airlines, hotels, buses, trains, etc have all been allowed to go back to business. I've never left a cruise ship sick, but almost every airline flight I've ended up sick with something. Cruise ships were already held to a higher standard. How do you know that the people on the cruise in the Spring picked up Covid on the ship? They very well could have been exposed in the airport/airplane on the way to the cruise and it incubated while out to sea.If people want to cruise, let them. Go back to normal. Sign a waiver and let people be If you must implement new protocols, maybe start with reduced capacity. Masks in common/crowded area. Handwashing/sanitizing stations throughout the ship and required before eating. Temperature checks before boarding. If someone doesn't feel comfortable cruising yet, then they don't cruise. People die from eating strawberries and peanuts, but we don't ban them. Those who are high risk just don't eat them. Same with this. You can't stop colds, flus, and other viruses. Flu shots have been around for years and yet every year the vaccine is barely effective",,,
CDC-2020-0087-3217,2020-09-15T04:00:00Z,JR,Saez,Comment from (name),"I believe that the Cruise Industry has stepped up and has conducted enough R&D having to deal with CoVid.  The Question is has the CDC completed an analysis of the protocols and measures proposed by the Cruise Industry?  IF so, then where is the feedback where the Cruise Industry can make adjustments to satisfy the fears of the CDC?The core issue isn't if a passenger or  a crew member will become positive during a Cruise, it's when. Unlike any service / hospitality industry, where Theme Parks, AirLines, bars and so ON can just wash their hands of a guess that can come and go with no concern, the Cruise Industry can't. SO the Question becomes, do they (the Cruise Lines) have pre-screening, testing, mitigation plans, operational protocols and memorandums of understandings with Countries being visited?  The Cruise Lines actually have a number of advantages that the average tourist industries does not.  Such as a system of contact tracing where they can take proactive actions to notify guests. With the new technologies involving testing, the on board Medical Teams could conduct rapid testing and take immediate steps to put their mitigation, quarantine and evacuation (if needed) plans in action. I have been on over 30 cruises.  A few of them had a minor outbreak of the NoroVirus.  I never felt unsafe or at risk of getting ill, because I use common sense self protection measures and have watched the Cruise Staff step up their game on cleanliness.  With the increase scrutiny that the Cruise Industry has been put under, I would feel even safer to take a cruise as soon as I can.  While places like restaurants, bars, beaches have been allowed to open in phases, the Cruise Industry has been singled out.  It's time for the CDC to conduct a fair assessment, create dialog that is a Win-Win for all, the CDC, the Cruise industry, the Economies (including Jobs and Businesses), communities and Cruisers/Vacationers.When cruises start again, the decision to go or not go; for whatever reason, is up to that individual.

CDC-2020-0087-3219,2020-09-15T04:00:00Z,Kevin,Birnbaum,Comment from (name),"I want to make this clear upfront - my wife and I LOVE TO CRUISE. We look forward to a trip every two years and then save for another one. It is economical, entertaining, delicious, and adventurous. However, until there's a vaccine for COVID 19, I think dollars are put before public safety. The cruise industry cites air travel as being allowed but not cruise lines. First, air travel, unfortunately, is a necessity for a lot of businesses. However, the air is recycled every two minutes using hospital certified filtration systems. People are together for a relatively short period of time as well and everyone still has to wear masks. Leisure cruising is not a necessity - just like going to a movie theater. Also, unlike an airplane where a worker can see if someone is not wearing a mask and enforce the rules, that's super doubtful for cruise passengers. On the side of the cruise line, they always want to make sure you have sanitized your hands going in and out of their buffet areas - people squirt the stuff on your hands for you. So kudos for that. But this is just too big. People don't follow the rules. There have already been cases where cruisers have gone to ""not approved"" destinations once docked and then are stranded there. Also, the cruise lines are not as an industry really trying to woo passengers with heavy discounts or better rooms, etc. And I haven't heard anything as to how a cruise line will compensate someone who gets COVID on their ship with paying for medical transportation, possible hospitalization, refunds for getting sick on their ships, and ongoing lifelong medical care. And what is the cruise industry doing to ensure the safety of their workers? Most of the help comes from third world countries and don't have a good time of it anyway being forced to sleep 4 in a tiny room. How are they being protected so that they don't infect those in their own countries once their tours of duty have ended?Again, my wife and I really miss going on a cruise. I am 64 and she is almost 70 and we both are in the prime target category to get COVID. And it's the seniors the cruise lines need to stay in business. ",,,
CDC-2020-0087-3214,2020-09-15T04:00:00Z,Thomas,Stacy,Comment from (name),"Given the current state of the pandemic I believe clients should go at their own risk. If you compare a cruise ship to a airplane, resort, or theme park I don't see much difference except a ship floats. Stopping cruise ships since March 14th hasn't prevented the spread of Covid through the entire world. 1. Follow all the same precautions implemented on land. Cruise lines need to make wearing a mask in tight public areas a must and sail a reduced capacity (60-80 percent) to allow for social distancing. 2. From my experiences cruise lines are already ahead of the game when it comes to protecting people from diseases in enclosed spaces. Take Norovirus for example, according to the CDC's own data cruise ships account for minuscule percent of total infections. And, with all of the increased hand washing stations and onboard cleaning the total number of infections continues to drop even though the number of people taking cruise vacations is increasing (minus 2020 due to covid). 3. I'm fairly sure the bad press the CDC and MSM give cruise lines are already enough to make sure all protocols are followed otherwise sentiment will sway away from going on cruises. If you are that worried about cruise lines not following the rule have them pay for a CDC representative go on each cruise ship moving forward. This would allow the cruise lines to return to business and the CDC to have a non-biased accountability piece in place.  4. MSC cruise line in Europe has proved that to be very feasible. A. It seems that quick testing is becoming more and more available. Quick testing done at the port will make sure no one submits a test before arrival but contracts the virus after taking the test.   b. At embarkation c. Unsure5. Make total pay (salary and gratuities) of crew the responsibility of the cruise line even if the crew is sick and unable to perform his or her's duties. a. Allow both passengers and crew to submit a sickness report on top of informing the cruise line management team. The passenger and crew report will be removed from passing through the cruise line management team prior to CDC submission.  6. To have a cruise ship set sail from a US port the ship could have on board enough Covid tests to test the total number number of souls on board three times over. On top of the tests the cruise ship should have telehealth with nurses capable of administering Covid medicine or a trained M.D. on board. Of course the needed Covid meds would also need be stored on the ship. Also, all HVAC filtration will need to updated to not recirculate air and have in place a filtration system capable of stopping most viruses. 7.All passengers will have to have a negative test to be released from the ship, but once they has tested negative they must leave, unless a dependent or share a cabin with a person who has tested positive, in order to reduce the number of people able to contract the virus. 8. All cruise lines must have a place to quarantine passengers until they are able to test negative. Quick testing will help greatly with this. 9. Given the fact that airline passengers are free to fly all over the country as long as they don't have a fever and are willing to wear a mask why should cruise lines be forced to go above and beyond that?  10. A) If a border closes during a cruise and a passenger or crew member is unable to return because of they foreign state preventing them from doing so I would one say that person should have done a better job of understanding the situation they are placing themselves in and two it is up that person to find alternate means of gaining entry to their home country. The cruise line will be responsible for providing the person with shelter till a negative test in provided to the affected person. B. Don't go to that port, skip it, move onc. As long as they have a negative test at the port I am fine with getting on a ship with them. 11. The only issue i see with this happening is the Jones act which prevents a foreign flagged vessel from not calling on foreign port before returning a US port. A case by case exemption would have to be allowed if this happens. 12. Funny how the only industry that had issues with this was the cruise industry but they were only following the rules you placed on them. So I guess the question is why did the cruise lines have issues following rules we placed on them knowing they wouldn't be able to complete the tasks asked of them without a herculean effort? As long as a crew member or guest test negative the CDC should treat them like a normal human and not punish them for going on a cruise.13. If it works on land make it so on a cruise ship, social distancing, masks, and no French kissing your neighbors. Make sure the HVAC does not recirculate air other than that don't reinvent the wheel.

The extended problem:  60+ passengers were then immediately released into the public.  Sorry, but when lives are literally at risk we cannot even allow the possibility of coronavirus spread, especially when it's fully preventable.   Cruise activity must remain halted.Earlier in the week a second of two cruise ships in Norway had an outbreak.   I'm sorry, but it's too dangerous to allow cruise ship activity before vaccinations are widely available and used.   These vessels are NOT delivering critical food and supplies.  Not even close.  Cruises are completely frivolous activities and we all continue to live in a global pandemic for God's sake.  Nobody can deny the fundamental facts.It will be fine to allow cruise activities AFTER vaccinations are available and widely distributed/used.  Until then this is a known global pandemic, lives are at stake, and the CDC/governments need to do their jobs.

They are the most equipped, most diligent and most pro-active in the travel industry.  Unlike buses, trains & aircraft, cruise ships allow the privilege of on-deck, open air ventilation, opportunity to vacate public spaces where necessary, and have the capability of vacating the vessel for cleaning while in ports of call.  On the flip side, cruise ships have the perfect infrastructure for containment and isolation, if required. (I have personally experienced being quarantined while sailing.)  I have no doubt that they will successfully adapt to the needs of the industry by establishing new precedents, technology and standards. From pre-screening and on-the-spot testing, contactless portals, they WILL make a huge changes.  They will modify their policies, training & educate staff, by applying new standards of health & cleanliness.  They will re-invent spaces, eliminate self-serve stations, limit occupancy by staggering events, meals & activities...  Things WILL change.  The CDC needs to stop demonizing cruising.  How is it safer for someone to fly across an ocean in a tube with recirculated air, but not OK to be on a ship when they can go outside if they choose?   People need to feel the sun on their face & breathe in the salty air.  The CDC may think they are saving lives, but instead they are creating a ton of mental health issues and suicide.  Whether it's a fire, drowning prevention or a virus... Safety has always been the cruise industry's utmost priority.  Allow the cruise lines to establish new protocol.  This is the ultimate opportunity for them to re-educate the entire travel industry, and instill a new confidence in the public as they lead this paramount recovery.

CDC-2020-0087-3246,2020-09-16T04:00:00Z,,,Comment from Juneau Convention & Visitors Bureau d/b/a Travel Juneau,"RE: CDC Docket No. CDC-2020-0087Resumption of Passenger Operations, Question #19:  Should cruise ship operators limit shore excursions? Cruise ship operators should not limit shore excursions. This constitutes overreach, as the CDC currently does not limit the number of visitor opportunities in any other visitor sector.  Placing a limit solely on the cruise sector is patently unfair, as the CDC has not limited the visitor options in non-port cities. For small port communities like those in Alaska that are not accessible except by air or water travel, such a limitation will stall economic development and growth. As the current travel crisis has many operators at financial risk, placing additional limits put those business owners and their communities at an unfair disadvantage relative to non-cruise destinations. Question #19a: What precautions should cruise ship operators take during shore excursions to prevent passengers and crew from being exposed to COVID-19?Perhaps this question could be, “What should shore excursion operators do to prevent transmission into or out of their communities?” Cruise ship operators should ensure their shore excursions have protocols and mitigation plans. Alaska operators, especially those contracted with the cruise lines, are well underway creating protocols and mitigation plans to reduce risk by working with the Alaska Travel Industry Association and using best practices from the CDC and other industry sectors. Cruise ship operators should ensure that protocols are communicated, consistent throughout a region (e.g., Southeast Alaska), and enforced. Every guest should know what to expect of each operator, and every guest should demonstrate personal responsibility by adhering to the operators’ plans. Question #19b:During shore excursions, how should cruise ship operators prevent transmission of COVID-19 into land-based communities? Cruise ship operators can have great deal of power in preventing the transmission of COVID-19 into land-based communities. One powerful tool would be to have every guest present a negative COVID-19 PCR test with results no more than 72 hours old; however, this is practical only if such tests were easily accessible, fast, and reliable. the CDC and cruise operators should push for their production. Another useful tool would be a no-fault/no penalty cancellation policy for guests. When faced with the prospect of losing thousands of dollars on a cruise, including the flight and ground transportation costs, many ill or asymptomatic guests will opt to board with the hopes they don’t get sicker.  However, the combination of quick testing and the ability to cancel within 24 hours of sailing, would deter sick guests from boarding. Keeping the virus off the ship to begin with is the ounce of prevention the lines need; combining prevention with robust industry- and region-wide mitigation plans for the ships and shore excursions gives the cruise industry a better opportunity for a successful restart.

CDC-2020-0087-3274,2020-09-16T04:00:00Z,Frederic,Mina,"Comment from Mina, Frederic","The pandemic makes it even more imperative for the CDC to finally step in to regulate the medical centers that currently offer woefully inadequate health care on cruise lines. Currently, ship medical centers operate as profit-making ventures not unlike their onboard casinos and shops. Worse, while the ship doctor--often a generalist--may technically be ""qualified"" to practice, the level of care can be as poor as that of a third-world nation. It may also be completely unavailable when the ship doctor is off duty. Administratively, cruise lines are extremely patient-unfriendly, charging exorbitant fees for services while refusing to accept payment from passengers' health insurances. The result is that passengers avoid using ship medical centers even if they desperately need care.There are many medical horror stories that I have observed firsthand aboard cruise ships of 2000-2500 passengers, including:  1) male having heart attack in dining room with CPR delayed and poorly administered by off-duty onboard doctor (the patient died), 2) female passenger sustaining open fracture of her arm falling down staircase, declared not in need of an airlift off (risking grave complications), treated solely with inadequate pain medication, and 3) an outbreak of norovirus that couldn't be brought under control because passengers refused to seek care by the cruise medical center/ship doctor. The threat of COVID-19 on top of these situations would just make everything more dire.To ensure cruise lines can safely operate in the era of the coronavirus, the CDC must regulate medical centers on all ships from all lines that embark or disembark from United States of America ports in these ways:1. Any ship with 1,000 or more passengers must offer 24-hour medical coverage by a physician certified in emergency room medicine.2. The medical center must be equipped not only with aspirins and diarrheal drugs, but also with advanced equipment and medications to treat events such as stroke, serious fractures and serious infections, heart attacks, etc.3. Rules must be established guaranteeing patients who develop serious conditions that put their health or lives in grave danger the right to be airlifted off ships when at sea.4. After pre-verifying passengers' legitimate health insurance plans, cruise lines medical centers MUST be made to accept payment for necessary treatment from them.5.

As with the flu the elderly are more at risk and it is their choice whether to cruise go to a resturant etc.When you go to the grocery store it may make you feel better about the virus because there is plastic over the charge card keypad but it is not changed brtween clints so whats the difference.Cashiers dont wear gloves and money is exchanged. You can walk thru a resturant with a mask on then take it off and eat and replace it to walk out? what does that really do?It seems as though the way the deaths are reported is of concern.too as if you die in a car accident but test positive for Covid you died of covid when it was really your injuries. More money for hospitals.this is political. My friend say when will this be over? after the election?We are a nation that promotes freedom of choice and this is being taken away from us driven by fear induced by the media.Both of my sons work daily as they are essentail workers they have family wife and kids.

I am personally appalled this is being opened to public comment.  Taxpayer money is utilized to run the CDC and to have experts to make this decisions.  In addition the cruise lines have done significant consideration of what changes they need to make in order to reduce the possibility of transmission of diseases.  They are the only large gatherings I know of that are required to report cases of transmissible diseases, which has set them up to be the whipping boy in this.  We all know that you can get Covid or Noro or whatever at the local grocery store, school events, ball games, protests, riots...you name it.  But none of them are required to report.  Hotels and Airlines are open and flying with masked and increased cleaning.  Why in the world would you rely on public opinion instead of expert opinion for these questions.  Why is it okay for stores, bars, public protesting and rioting, church services, airplanes, hotels, etc to be open and functional and not cruise lines.  The CDC in conjunction with the Cruise Lines should be setting these priorities and changes, not the public.  Please do your job and get the cruise lines traveling again..  Please.",,,

This year we had 2 cruises cancelled due to COVID19. and at the time they should have because not much was known about the virus in March. While I understand the health risk involved I don't understand why the cruise industry has still been singled out and accused of being the main spreader of COVID19 or any virus. I also do not know why the cruise industry in the US has not at least been given a chance to start operation on a limited bases and with strict protocols in place. Other industries have been allowed to re-open. Here in New Jersey restaurants, movie theaters and gyms are opening with strict protocols in place as so far the results have been positive. I also do not understand how the CDC can allow air lines to operate with people sitting inches apart yet prevent cruise lines from least trying to start in a limited capacity. I have a friend that every time she flies she gets either the flu or a respiratory infection yet air line can fly at full capacity and from what I have seen they do not even enforce their own mask protocols.I think we have seen that cruising in Europe can be safely restarted with strict procedures not only in place but aggressively enforced by the cruise line. Right now as much as I want to get back on a cruise ship, I would not cruise unless the following protocols were not only in place but strictly enforced by the cruise line1) All passenger need to be tested before boarding the ship and when available proof of vaccination.2) Social distancing policies that need to be enforced in all areas of the ship when possible3) Suspension of self serve buffet - while I would want the buffet to be available they should have staff serve the food to the guest4) Masks need to be required at all venues on the ship where social distancing is not possible. Again it has to be strictly enforced - no exception5) cruise line only excursions - no exceptions6) virtual muster drills or muster drills in very small groups7) assigned check in time that but be strictly adhered to - again no exceptions 8) On line check in to cut down on times waiting in check in lines9) required daily temperature checks and rechecked when rebounding after an excursionIf anyone violate theses procedure and protocols they must be taken off the ship at the next port of call as were the passengers on the recent MSC cruise in Italy who wandered off from their excursion. Eventually the virus will be either controlled or fade away and thing can be relaxed but until then I feel the protocols and procedures being enforced by MSC, TUI and Costa will allow us to safely return to the vacations we love.

As an avid traveler I can tell you the most cleanest/sanitary place I feel comfortable is on a cruise ship. The staff is always cleaning and encouraging people to wash their hands. Any sort of travel is a risk and cruising holds no more risk then air, train or hotel travel. Really it comes down to its a person choice whether they want to cruise or not. They take the risk and they know what can happen. Just like they can catch anything from visiting a foreign country. The recovery rate is between 99% there is no reason to stop this form of travel.

We have helped over 110.000 people plan cruises in the past 31 years and have found that so many people prefer cruising as their top priority for their vacations. We have had a staff of 28 employees and everyone of us have been negatively affected.  Hundreds of our clients are telling us thay are ready to go NOW and are comfortable that they will be safe with all the fantastic new safety protocols that will be in place. Mimi and I are comfortable too that the major CLIA cruise line members are ready to get back cruising and are well prepared to begin cruising again IMMEDIATELY. Not only has this pandemic affected our business by well over $10,000,000 and forced us to furlough employees that we did not want to let go, think what it has done to the cruise industry in total. DEVESTATING in lost jobs and lost revenue.Please understand that everything we are seeing is those who are not afraid to vacation are vacationing, and those who are not are simply NOT planning vacations. The all inclusive resorts have already opened up successfully in Mexico, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic.  Airlines are increasing the number of flights domestically and to the areas where these resorts are. They will increase more flights just as soon as they hear that the ocean cruise ships will be cruising again. Again, thousands of jobs, and the residual benefits economically will begin to happen again.  In summary, from a business owner and an avid cruiser (I have been on well over 100 cruises on almost every cruise line), it is time for the CDC to allow the cruise industry to get back to helping make memories that last a lifetime for their cruise guests.  These cruise lines are more prepared than you think to cruise again immediately and safer than they have ever been.  Sincerely, Mark Comfort , owner of Cruise Holidays of Kansas City",,,

With our year-round great weather, acclaimed attractions, and great places to enjoy shopping, dining, and entertainment options, it is also no wonder San Diego is a popular point of embarkation for cruise passengers. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has paralyzed nearly all of the worldwide travel and tourism industry, including the cruise line companies. In turn, this has led to a drop off in business for a number of San Diego businesses, both those that support the cruise industry as vendors and suppliers, as well as those frequented by cruise ship passengers both before and after their voyages. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the cruise industry should work together to make sure that cruise ships are ready to resume sailing with the utmost care and precautions taken to protect the health of their crews and customers. In reply to questions 1-3 of the Request for Information issues by the CDC, the industry is well on their way to crafting their plans and guidelines to do just that, working with medical experts to study a variety of options, such as more frequent screenings of passengers, as well as implementing needed measures for physical distancing on board, changes to shore excursions, training for crew and ship medical personnel, enhanced sanitization and cleaning of frequently used areas, modification or elimination of buffet dining, and more.As both a resident and a policymaker for the City of San Diego, I support the industry’s efforts to develop these protocols and am confident that the implementation of these additional safeguards will make the industry far and away safer and more secure for cruise passengers than ever before. I am grateful for the cruise industry’s efforts in this respect, and look forward to welcoming the cruise industry back to San Diego soon.

I must however express my concern regarding cruise lines dictating what excursions their passengers can utilize.

All business must be given a fighting chance to survive the 2021 season, not just those that have long-standing relationships with the cruise line. Independent tour operators, restaurants, and shops provide an integral part of the Alaskan experience and having them be skipped my cruise traffic would bankrupt these entrepreneurs.

The spread of infectious diseases, from norovirus to legionnaires, is not a new problem. The short term focus on COVID does not address the underlying questions of sanitation and overcrowding.  The government should take a broader view to create standards to prevent the spread of infectious disease and not regulate for COVID in particular.  This will give the industry greater opportunity for long term planning that may include some fundamental restructuring of the business model.  In addition, cruise ports need to have plans in place that will allow for the safe disembarkation of passengers and crew in the event of an outbreak onboard.  This is essential to prevent the spread of to uninfected people who are confined.

No doubt a cruise ship has never sailed where at least one person did not become ill either - with some ailment or another.  I think we have all learned a valuable lesson in cleaning, keeping hand sanitizer, don't touch unless you have to, masking, etc.  I think the cruise ships can sail with the extra precautions they are taking for increased cleaning, and I think they have the right to enforce masking (and SHOULD enforce masking).  We each have the right to choose if we want to sail under those conditions.  If you are uncomfortable masking, don't choose to go now.  Those who are willing to mask, have a great time.  It's that simple.  I'm not opposed to the temperature scans, although I think they are mostly flawed (my temperature usually comes in at 94.1 with those things which makes me barely alive!!) but if they find the outliers then that is one more defense against unnecessary spread.  I think the ships should be allowed to sail if they are committed to the extra cleaning and sanitizing, enforce typical preventative measures (e.g. masking, distancing where possible).  I think they also have the right to ask passengers to commit (in writing) that they will adhere to the protocols like masking, hand washing, distancing where possible, and protocols around the dining/food areas.

The Diamond Princess outbreak was greatly magnified when the Japanese government would not allow the ship to debark. Passengers traveling home by private vehicle, as I do, should certainly be allowed to go home. The crew should receive the same attention to their health as the passengers. Testing at frequent intervals could be helpful.Regarding a vaccine, when one is available, I feel the crew should be required to have it.  I would love to have the same for passengers, but I can hear the outcries about personal freedoms already.I am ready and eagerly anticipating my next cruise, with my 82 year old mother.  I have a full box of masks, lots of hand sanitizer and am ready to go. Please do not be more harsh on cruise lines than on the motorcycle conventions, bar crowds, airlines, etc. ",,,
CDC-2020-0087-3236,2020-09-16T04:00:00Z,Joyce,Matthews,Comment from (name),"I own a home based travel agency and my business has suffered. Here are my comments regarding the following questions.9. Cruise passengers should not be treated differently from other passengers when they travel on airlines to the cruise port. Most cruises are booked through travel advisors and we were here to assist our passengers with all their questions about cancelled cruises, refunds, etc. 10. My cruise passengers have to be flexible due to weather and security concerns now, so I am sure they will be supportive of avoiding ports that have a prevalence of COVID19. Cruise ships are unique in that they can change their itinerary, hotels and home rentals cannot do that. A regiment of testing/screening passengers before cruising should be the same for all.16. Cruise lines should follow strict protocols to ensure the safety of all passengers. If someone has symptoms or confirmed test then those passengers should be denied boarding. I always strongly recommend travel protection for my clients and I will continue to do so.17. Cruise lines should be able to accommodate the appropriate social distancing requirements by the time sailing resumes to ensure passenger safety. Not sailing at all definitely is impacting the cruise line and me as a business. Reduced capacity will at least allow some income for me. I am not sure if that makes it viable for cruise lines or not.18. If the protocols for cleaning, masks, and social distancing are followed and enforced, then I am not sure that the length of the cruise matters.19. Cruisers will be following safety protocols on the ship so they should be lower risk to the location. Excursions that are outside, in small groups, require social distancing and masks will make the most sense to offer.23. Guidelines are needed for this, so the passengers understand what can happen. I stronger recommend trip interruption insurance for the reason.24. Cancel for any reason insurance will eliminate this problem. Cruise lines should have this type of protection to offer their cruise passengers to make it a seamless booking process and do away with a passengers reluctance to cancel their trip.26. Same as #19",,,

CDC-2020-0087-3252,2020-09-16T04:00:00Z,Wendy,Anonymous,Comment from (name),"Docket CDC-2020-0087.  As a passenger on Ruby Princess which disembarked March 19, 2020 who was infectedwith covid-19 onboard here are my thoughts.Firstly Ruby Princess departure on March 8, 2020 should have been cancelled by the operator as the risk was already well known and cruises before and after that sailing were cancelled by the operator as the situation evolved.   Secondly, wewere well aware of covid 19 and took plenty of ppe such as gloves, sanitiser, disinfectants of all types I still got infected. Myhusband wasn't.  How, where?  I experienced  non typical symptoms on board that were not recognised then, but have sincebeen documented.  We would have cancelled our trip ourselves had a full refund been available from Princess Cruises or viatravel insurance.  Losing hard earned savings to cruise companies or insurers for no travel will encourage people to take risks against their better judgement.  While the cruise companies have been singled out for attention in this debacle the companies issuing travel insurance have escaped with virtually no oversight.  We booked and paid before Covid-19 even broke out in Wuhan and paid for travelinsurance with cancellation cover that proved worthless in covering us for an unknown virus that broke loose after this.  Travel insurance companies should be compelled to accept some responsibility or at least flexibility in this scenario.  For example if customers want ""full cancellation protection including unknown events such as pandemics and outbreaks"" and areprepared to pay more for it, that should be available.  Especially as cruise customers are encouraged to book and pay so farin advance.  In the event of a second or third wave or some future novel virus outbreak people would be able to cancel without fearof losing their hard earned savings.  During the disembarking/embarking process the screening and cleaning process should take longer and port operators shouldbe considerate of this fact, allowing the companies time to complete deep cleaning processes.  When on board, passengers should be actively discouraged from crowding in lifts at all times and lifts and stairwells during excursions especially those that use the ship tenders.  Companies should investigate increasing their number of tendes andlifts on future vessels.   Reporting, screening and testing of sick passengers should be improved (as highlighted in the Ruby Princess inquiry) to ensureall government authorities have current accurate details of passengers who are being treated for conditions that may becorona virus related.  All non standard symptoms should be publcised to passengers to report if they experience them and they be able to attend sick bay without fear of large fees.  Testing should be onboard and immediate.  Sick passengers and theirclose contacts (ie travelling companions should be removed to a separate part of the ship for treatment and not allowed tomingle with other passengers.  I personally was spoken to and touched by a close contact and then saw them wheeling thesick passenger off the ship with no safety controls.  They should then be disembarked separately to quarantine off the ship.  Cruise companies should have an emergency quarantine plan for each and every sailing and have arrangements for postdisembarkation quarantine off the ship in the event of an outbreak of covid 19 or any other extremely infectious agent in thefuture.  This should be a mandatory condition of being allowed to sail.  It should not be left to government authorities to arrange hastily as this led to serious shortcoming in NSW after Ruby Princess (we should have been quarantined and expected to be)  Crew should self isolate before joining ships and should be tested before boarding and during sailings with extra attention to kitchen staff, foodand beverage staff and highly mobile staff who work in multiple areas of the ships.   All future ships should be designed to house crew in separate quarters and ships retrofitted where possible.  If a crew member is symptomatic they should be removedimmediately to a separate area to other crew and their cabin sealed/decontaminated.  As we saw on the Ruby Princess last sailing in the supposedly safe New Zealand waters, no where can be considered ""safe""while this virus is at large.  Everywhere should be considered to be potentially infected by covid-19.  It should be clear to all (especially passengers) what steps are to be taken if someone is trying to board with any symptoms and this should be made clear in the embarkation planning for passengers.  We had no idea what would happen if wedeveloped flu like symptoms by our arrival on Ruby Princess.  The companies should be wholly or partially responsible for this. All measures implemented should remain in place until the virus has been eliminated and reviewed on a regular basis afterthis time so as to be ready for the next pandemic level virus that will inevitably arise.

CDC-2020-0087-3240,2020-09-16T04:00:00Z,Robin,Washington,Comment from (name),"The cruise industry has a lot of protocols in place that can be modified.  Unlike vacations elsewhere, they control the dining, bars, entertainment, children's programs, spas, etc all by one company, which is very different than going to a city or beach area.  There will be rates of infection on ships, just like there will be at schools, workplaces, restaurants, neighborhoods etc.  A positive case shouldn't mean the end of a sailing.  There should be protocols for quarantining onboard and appropriate staffing to sufficiently and safely serve those guests.  A temp & symptom check should be done daily.  All with symptoms should be tested onboard and rapid results should be made available.  Masks should be required for Fall 2020 sailings.  Entertainment should be spaced out differently with reservation systems to limit the number of guests and spread out seating.  If rapid testing is available, it should be used for all guests pre-boarding.  The expense can be included as a fee to the guests. Each guest fee should reflect maybe the cost of 1.25 or 1.5 tests to cover additional testing may need to be conducted during the cruise. Any additional testing expense beyond that budget should be covered by the cruise line. States, such as Florida, need to provide more vigilance in protocols to avoid the spread of guests as they arrive to those port cities. Shuttles, airports, taxis/shared ride services and hotels should be cruiseline certified in order to be recommended to passengers.  There should be medical staff trained in COVID-19 response and additional medical equipment in the case of needing to provide more extensive care.  ",,,

CDC-2020-0087-3286,2020-09-17T04:00:00Z,Adriana,Mendez,Comment from (name),"I read today in Cruise Critic that cruise companies are defying CDC guidelines and are ""eager"" to get back to sailing. Under no circumstances should the CDC buckle down to their demands. Public health and safety should be paramount. Sailing should resume only after it is absolutely safe to do so. The cruise lines measures are all fine and good, but they are no GUARANTEE of an infection-free journey.  It is not pleasurable to think of sailing and having to deal with temperature checks, or, worse, the possibility of being denied boarding. Worse yet is the chance of getting the virus.  There are too many imponderables, beginning with the crew and staff, who come from many countries and places. What guarantee does the public have that all ship employees are risk-free? None whatsoever.In my mind, again, the only safe and sane policy is to allow cruise ships to resume sailing only when it is 100% safe to do so. That may be a few months after the vaccine, as that is not a guarantee, only a preventive measure.  So what I mean by 100%. safe is when the pandemic is fully abated, fully died down, and there's no global risk any more.I have sailed both as a cruise lecturer and paying customer. I was scheduled to speak on a Panama Canal cruise leaving last March which was eventually canceled. When I tried to cancel 2 weeks before as the situation was growing quite serious, I was asked to reconsider.  The cruise company has cancelled all itineraries for 2020, which I think is absolutely the right thing to do.Let's not let corporate greed or profit-motive interfere with the basic right to be healthy.  This pandemic calls for larger-than-life measures.I thank the CDC for keeping up and maintaining strict standards that ensure public safety,Cruise critic said there were 59 questions, but I do not see the questionnaire.  If you can email me the questionnaire, I would be happy to fill it out.  Otherwise, this pretty much sums up my position.Thank you for allowing the public to comment.",,,

Masks required when possible on excursions. Based on the # infected and amount of people tested, numbers are low. This isn't going to go away. We need to start moving forward.

Enforce need for passports instead of real ID for travel.  So that if a passenger breaks the safety bubble, they can be booted off the ship.  They will need a passport to fly back home.  And back up the cruise line over this.5. Clear cut waivers to be signed that IF the passenger breaks them, there is NO warning.

I understand more clusters of positive COVID-19 cases were found on cruise lines than in air travelers. But there is a big reason for that, airlines were not testing, cruise lines did, airlines had approvals to land passengers, cruise lines were denied access to ports and terminals. There are many lessons to be learned from this, please do what is right, review their plans and allow those cruise lines following a strict protocols to return sailing, protecting this multi-billion dollar industry, $50B to be more exact is critical for the US and world economy. Miami, cruise capital of the world, loses 290 job daily.  A suggestion I'd like to make is that despite their common efforts as an industry, not all cruise lines are managed or operated equally. I strongly propose the institution of a star system for each of the cruise lines similar to the star system found for hotels. The star rating system was designed to measure the quality of hotels.  We can use this for cruise ships, and in this way, they are measured on their quality, and protocols above the minimum standards; this information will be easily understood by the consumer before booking and allow for better understanding of across quality in cruise lines. There are too many cases, where a cruise ship with basic, limited accommodations is equally compared with a large one of luxury accommodations, upscale establishments, fully staffed, and safety and environmental protocols that exceed the minimum guidelines. Cruise lines are not all are managed or operated equally, and providing for a star system like distinction around minimum standards for maintenance and passengers operations would be helpful to the health and safety of consumer and industry as a whole.

In past years you have more outbreaks of  Virus at hotels than cruise lines. Cruise lines have random health inspections and resorts do not. The CDC states because airlines change out passengers several times a day. I this virus as catchy as you say isn't that more risk of spreading this disease. Same thing. Is there a reason the CDC does not feel it needs to mandate airlines?Cruising should be up to the us to decide whether we feel safe cruising or not. Passengers that cruise already know that the crew works hard and already sanitize railings, clean the rooms, well really the whole ship all day. I believe temperature checks are a good idea before boarding.If someone feels ill they go to the medic and have them decide whether to quarantine to your cabin or not. Cruse lines already have all these measures in place already.  Cruise ships are so much cleaner than some hotels and planes. I just dont understand why the cruise lines are being picked on compared to the rest of the vacation industries. I feel safer on a cruise ship than going to the store. Why is it I can go to work each day, yes I am essential worker, in fact my whole family is and we still are ready to step on a cruise ship but the CDC is making it so difficult to do so.

I will not be able to go due to the 14 day quarantine that is required afterwards.  Even so, I would not chose to go until a vaccine is available.  To be stuck in another country while on a cruise with no where to go scares me and I will not take that chance.   If the US is not able to have concerts where people only spend a few hours together, then I think a 7 day cruise spent with hundreds of people should be out of the question.",,,
CDC-2020-0087-3291,2020-09-17T04:00:00Z,Theodore,Washington,"Comment from Washington , Theodore ","1. Many of the cruise industry leaders have developed plans. I like all of the precautions MSC, NCL, & Royal Carribean are incorporating. 2. The cruise ships should have a doctor, and a few nurses onboard every ship.3. I suggest having daily walkthroughs. Every ship should have a inspection team. Also, Independent auditors which performs quarterly inspections on every ship. 4. Onboard testing should be performed upon entering the port.  Also, all ships should have the wrist bands which some cruise lines are currently using. These wristbands will detect your temperature, the people you come in contact with and several other health features. 4A. Specimen testing shouldn’t be done on the ship unless a passenger has some symptoms. 4B. Specimen testing should be done  3-5 days prior to boarding a ship. Therefore, no testing should be done unless someone has some of the symptoms. The crew can wear the medical wristbands which the passengers will wear. 4C. The financial cost will increase the price of the cruise. This testing will be incredibly expensive if passengers and crew members are tested regularly. 5. Crew members shouldn’t put others in risk. They should report to the medical staff (Sick Call) immediately. 5A. The medical doctor should notify the captain & the cruise line operations center. However, they must report to The CDC. If there’s a conflict, 6. 70% capacity should be manageable for the initial or restarting of cruising. 7. The cruise industry should work with all the ports to ensure they all have accurate medical facilities, and procedures for COVID-19 emergencies.8. All ports of entry should establish training procedures. Training should be ongoing and checked by the independent auditors. 9. The cruise owners must have meetings with the airlines and other traveling modes. They should design a plan for these emergencies. 10. A- There must have meeting involving all people involved in the cruise industry. They must have select representatives at this meeting. There focus must be to  formulate a plan. 10B. Therefore, they won’t turn around a ship unless it’s vital for the safety of their citizens. 10C. Any decisions made to keep a sick person, must be clear by the countries chief medical staff.11. If ships are denied entry to their port, the crew should contact their operations. The operations should contact the ports. 12. Once a passenger has been identified as positive for COVID-19, they should be restricted to their cabins. All others should be free to enjoy their voyage. 13. The wristband which I mentioned earlier in this survey. 14. No, if they use the procedures I’ve mentioned earlier.15. There are successful cruises sailing in Europe. 16. If the industry continues to train and inspect their crews, and passengers, COVID-19 will not affect the industry. 16A. Yes, if a passenger is positive for COVID-19, they should not board. 16B. Yes, they should deny boarding to all passengers which tested positive COVID-19 for 28 days. 16C. The wristbands, hiring a medical staff, and an audit team that I mentioned earlier in this survey. 16D. No, they shouldn’t deny anyone unless they have tested positive in the past 28 days. 16E. The crew can use precautions but, the person hasn’t tested positive. 16F. Yes, they should test at the port. 16G. No, they should escort the positive passengers sick bay at the port.17. Yes, they should operate at 70%. 17A. The ships should continue to operate at this capacity until directed by CDC. 17B. Cruise ships are able to make a profit at a capacity of 50%. The 70% will help their losses. 17C. No, they should have to provide this information. 18. No, the cruise ships shouldn’t change the amount of sail days. 18A. Decreasing the length of the voyage will not decrease the likelihood for contacting the virus. 18B. No, the CDC should do these studies.19. Yes, we should gradually increase the excursions over time. 19A. MSC only allows guided tours. The entire industry should follow their lead. 19B. All passengers which don’t stay with the guided excursion must not be allowed to revised the ship.20. No. 20A. It would be a good idea to spread out the crew. 21. Stress management, and other mental health classes, and counseling.22. Staggering the disembarkation of the ship. 23. The cruises identified with positive testing should have a deep cleansing. 24. A- The cruise lines should offer COVID-19 cancellation insurance. 24B. No they shouldn’t be prejudged. 24C. The passenger should have the insurance. 25. The wristbands will alert the medical staff. 26. A- stagger the embarkation and disembarkation times. 26B. All training should be done on the cruise line app prior to boarding. 26C. Stagger dinning- have reservations for dinning. 26D. Reservations for all shows on the cruise app or sign up at a computer prior to the show. 27. All cruise lines could higher a Performance Improvement Specialist. 28. Yes, however a person can not prevent these cases. ",,,

First, the onboard air pollution is harmful to the passengers and to the crew. The ultra-fine air pollution from the ship's exhaust is bad for our health. Cruise ships need to switch to cleaner fuels and need to use stronger filters to lower ultrafine air pollution. Second, cruise ships are running the cheapest and dirtiest fuel. This contributes to climate change and is hazardous to our health. The fuel relates to health because the burning of dirty fuel can create large amounts of smog pollutants. Cruise ships should try to avoid preferring profit over the health of the passengers and the places they go to. Third, there are a lot of reports of the crew and the passengers testing positive with COVID-19 where cruise ships have started sailing. My Source: https://www.stand.earth/",,,

We have learned so much about this virus on how it transmits.  I know several people are ready to get on the ship for vacationing.

Temperature check before anyone is allowed to board the ship and additional checks while cruising. We know that  face covering help to stop the transmission of the disease, so mandating the cruisers wear face covering while not on deck is mandatory.  Better ventilation for all indoor spaces including bars and restaurants with no one allowed to enter that has a temperature. Buffets are a mainstay of the cruise experience, so why not still have buffets but with a server to ""dish"" the selections to diners cafeteria style.

The cruise, hotel and airline industries are suffering. The CDC has the power to provide guidance so we can resume passenger operations.  Responding to your 28 questions......The cruise ships have always incorporated established sanitation measures; I believe the ships' cleanliness rival that of hospitals. The issue is with those who board the vessels ( check in and following shore excursions). Passengers should have regular temperature checks and should have negative COVID -19 tests at the start of the cruise. Ships always carry great medical staff,  but now need to have cabins set aside for isolation so as to manage a potential COVID 19 case.  (""Uncruise"", ""Paul Gauguin"" and ""Hurtigruten"" set sail recently and post departure found passengers who tested positive for the virus; the three cruise lines had procedures in place and handled the situations positively). Ideally, you need to find the ""fool proof"" test that can be administered on board the ship ( and on land!) with immediate positive( or negative results). The crews' health must be monitored in the same way as the passengers. The crew members may need single cabins so as to keep physical distance. They must be encouraged to report any COVID-like symptoms to the medical staff. The cruise lines must limit the number of passengers on board their ships during this time.If there is an ill passenger or crew member, you need to have a plan for seaport communities to accept sick passengers. (The United States must improve its overall health so as to avoid all the border closures).There are several things that the cruise lines can do to reduce any transmission on board the ships. Carry fewer passengers. Avoid selling inside cabins. Use special disinfecting UV lights. INSIST that passengers sanitize their hands regularly. (I have witnessed passengers' verbal abuse when staff asked them to sanitize). Install sinks with hot water and soap outside the dining rooms so hands must be clean prior to dining. Disinfect all pens regularly. So often, when checking into the cruise, portside, the same pens were handled by multiple guests! Great way to start the cruise with viruses!  Everyone MUST wear a face covering other than in the staterooms. Have ""social distancing"" rules in place beside the pools, in the casinos, showrooms and lounges! We can do this.Perhaps increase the price of the cruise fares to cover these COVID-19 precautions? Allow passengers to cancel the cruise without penalty should they become ill ( and insist on special travel protection coverage).In conclusion, I believe the cruise ships are primed to sail. They have measures in place and it is our fault since we can not control our COVID 19 hospitalization numbers and deaths. Few seaports want our cruise ships to visit since we are ""carriers"" of the virus.  This  upcoming  week several ships with Mediterranean itineraries  are departing from Italian ports. America, we need to get ""our act together"" so as to ply the world's oceans soon ! ",,,

Due to our Captain Carl Smith and the dilligence of the crew and passengers, we successfully arrived back to Miami without Covid-19 on board.  You are looking for what it will take to cruise again. Diligence of Both the crew and passengers in a combined effort. We also know that people are not kind or considerate of others. My suggestions:  The crew needs to be on board and quarantined  before departure to make sure they have not contracted the virus during their travels to the new job. Same for entertainers. They also need to stay onboard if the cruise is to stop at any ports. Possible safe areas put in place on port stops, so that the crew / entertainers can catch some air but stay safe. Passengers are to be in monitored areas or Tours. As for passengers, I agree there should be a lessened capacity, maybe spacing cabins at the same time people traveling together stay close. Logistical nightmare but doable.  Masks and social distancing, this needs to be enforced with the terms being removal as the airlines does. The cruise lines will not be hurting their reputations by being strick. Sometimes a strong line is a necessity. During this stage, I suggest assigned dining for all, utilizing the buffet as a dinning room. This controls some of the wandering. Of course people can opt for the fine dining venues if open.  With all this being said, There must be a platform set. Forms that say exactly what is required of the passenger , I do not think it is asking to much for a 72 hour test like what Hawaii is purposing. This form says that if a passenger boards the ship after knowingly being in contact with a Covid positive person they are liable legally and can be fined up to $ 25000.00 (?), this should deter those that wish to make a mockery of things. The airlines have been flying now without the middle seats empty, I have yet to hear of positive cases popping up.

CDC-2020-0087-3572,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Scarlett,Cmiel,"Comment from Cmiel, Scarlett","I have an autoimmune disease and was very leery of cruising as I did not want to get a norovirus or some other sickness while onboard the ship. I did alot of research and discovered that the major cruise lines: NCL and Royal Caribbean ranked very high in safety and security for their passengers. I took a gamble in 2015 and went on my first cruise. I have been on 11 total cruises and have never contracted an illness. I can attest that the cruise industry does take the safety of its passengers quite seriously and I, for one, would feel safer (from viruses, COVID-19, etc.) on a cruise ship than I do at my local grocery store, at a restaurant, traveling in an airplane, staying in a hotel and nearly every other non-cruise related activity. The cruise industry has been nearly decimated by 6 months of inactivity and I feel extremely confident that their safety precautions will be top notch as they last thing they will want is to be forced to undergo another no-sail order which might bankrupt them entirely. If airplanes can fly, resorts and hotels can have guests, restaurants can serve customers then there is no logical reason that cruise lines can't be allowed to operate. As a side note, I was on the very least cruise ship to set sail out of Miami before the no-sail order and the security protocols on that cruise were above and beyond anything I had seen before and not a single passenger came home with COVID-19. The industry is prepared and can handle keeping passengers safe.",,,
CDC-2020-0087-3573,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,,,Comment from Worldwide Cruise & Travel,"#10: I own a Travel Agency, the Cruise Industry communicates with travel advisors and we support clients onboard or before boarding for any changes required. Cruise lines adapt quickly and communicate with Advisors efficiently. According to CLIA Over 75% of cruises and over 90% of Luxury Cruises are sold by Travel Advisors. We are on the front line and can assist with the Management of this pandemic in the Cruise Industry.#16:Cruise lines are using leading epidemiologists to structure enhanced screening.If all are screened and tested then no one boards with the virus. After vaccination is found all passengers present proof of vaccination. Follow sane guidelines as the Air and Hotel Industries.#17. Reduced capacity is very easy for cruiselines until vaccine is found. Some are already planning for this.#18:Shorter voyages are OK IF it can be proven that shortening the voyage decreases the Virus. Has any other sector of the travel industry proven this or been required to prove this by CDC?#19: When going ashore the passengers must follow the guidelines set forth by the CDC.#23: This works against the cruise industry comeback and instills fear, not confidence. The enhanced screening measures should eliminate any onboard cases. Its all about the pre-screening. IF a case gets onboard, aggressive measures should be in place.#24: To ease concerns YES, Refunds in all cases with commission protection if cruise has been paid in full.OR require that Travel Insurance companies include coverage for pandemics in the future.#26: Cruise lines should be handled the same as other modes of transport and travel. How do airlines do it? How do hotels do it? These are mostly health and safety based issues. The cruise ships with existing enhanced cleaning, and sanitary measures are already far more sanitary than any other segment of the travel industry. Especially in the Luxury sector with less passengers, more space and very stringent health and safety policies already in place. The motto of the Cruise Industry has always been and always will be ""Safety First"". Cruise Lines are already advanced in their comeback planning. PLEASE confer with them and figure this out ASAP. They and we as Travel Professionals are all waiting on CDC to release the guidelines so we can get this industry moving before they go out of buisness.

CDC-2020-0087-3581,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Michael,Vitale,"Comment from Vitale, Michael","I am commenting as a member of the public and a frequent cruiser.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has mandated a “no sail order” for nearly 6 months, which prevents any cruise line from departing or returning to a U.S. Port of Call.  This, coupled with Congress choosing not to provide any federal stimulus money to the cruise ship companies, has left many cruise line operators in crisis mode, having to borrow billions of dollars off lines of credit to continue operations.  It is also hurting cruise line employees, port cities across the world, U.S. stockholders of cruise ship companies, and U.S. Citizens who are dependent on the cruise lines to earn a living.  Furthermore, policies allowing consumers to “shift” their 2020 cruises to 2021 has contributed to a steep rise in prices and lack of availability going forward.  Airlines have been permitted to operate throughout the pandemic, as have other industries that operate in tight spaces, like theme parks, restaurants, hotels, car services, etc.  There is no valid reason for cruising to not be permitted to operate with safety restrictions.  Cruisers have the option of booking rooms with exterior access like balconies, dining alone in their room or on the pool deck, or eating off-ship outdoors in restaurants at various ports of call.  Furthermore, quite simply, anyone who is high risk has the option to not cruise at all until they feel it is safe.  Doing away with a no-sail order does not require anyone to cruise, it just gives Americans the option to do so if they so choose.  The CDC can implement less extreme restrictions than a full cruise ban.  Safety measures such as temperature checks, mandatory face coverings, 50% capacity at cruise ship restaurants, staggered dining and showtimes, staggered embarkation and disembarkation, and elimination of excursions where social distancing is not possible make more sense.  For instance, many cruisers prefer ""freestyle"" dining options which permit them to dine at less standard times, anyway.  Dining rooms and buffets can operate at 50% capacity and cruise ships can be encouraged to offer more ""to go"" options.  The CDC could also require cruise lines to limit booking of interior rooms, sail at less than capacity, do away with in-person muster drills, and restrict where travelers can visit at certain ports of call.  Now that we know that COVID-19 does not spread easily by way of touching common surfaces (as opposed to say, norovirus), and that it spreads more by way of the inhalation of respiratory droplets and other aerosolized viral particles, there is less of a reason to single out cruise lines for suspension, as similar social distancing guidelines can be imposed at sea as they are on land.In short, the no sail order was a necessary but financially crippling decision that is no longer required.  The CDC should not decide what industries should live or die.  I would support the immediate sunset of the no sail order in favor of less restrictive safety measures.",,,

CDC-2020-0087-3520,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Taylor,Reitsma,"Comment from Reitsma, Taylor","I work for a company that creates group travel events on Cruise ships. We have been in the cruise business since 1981. It is my strong belief that cruise operations need to begin again without further delay, and for the following reasons: 1. The Cruise industry as a whole regularly submits itself to health and safety inspections as per US and Maritime regulations. 2. The Cruise industry as a whole has in place self-regulation protocols, as do the individual cruise lines for their ships. 3. Cruise industry standards already exceed those of the regulatory authorities, and in the case of Covid-19, this is no exception. 4. The major cruise lines have developed extensive safe operations plans in response to Covid 19, which have been submitted for review by CDC. 5. Covid-19 was transported and spread around the world on airplanes, not on cruise ships. 6. No other sector of the transportation industry has been put under the same stop order or level of scrutiny (e.g. public comment period, etc.). This seems an unfair and highly prejudiced approach. I do not believe that the CDC or any agency of the government should be choosing winners and losers, but using consistent standards across the transportation industry. 7. While there were a few notable incidents where cruise vessels experienced Covid-19 outbreaks, in those few cases, the situation was exacerbated by local authorities in port countries who did not allow the sick passengers and crew to be removed for treatment, therefore endangering the other passengers and crew. 8. At the time of those outbreaks, very little was known about Covid-19 and its transmission, and there were no recognized therapies. Today, that is no longer the case as much more is understood about the disease, its affect on vulnerable populations, its 99.98% survivor-ability rate, as well as options for prevention and various therapies. 9. Cruise lines are anxious to cooperate and resume their valuable and desired services as soon as possible, and should be allowed to do so. 10. Cruise lines should not be treated differently than other transportation systems. Below are answers to some of the questions:17. The cruise industry generates over $53 billion dollars in economic activity annually and supports 421,000 American jobs. By reducing passenger and crew loads, this will have a massive impact on the American economy. a. This is not necessary with the increased screening prior to sailing. b. The impact of reducing passenger counts will have an extreme impact; ship operations overhead, onboard sales in all departments, tourism in ports c. The cruise industry already has safety and health standards that exceed other travel industries. They should not be held accountable to provide scientific evidence that reducing passenger counts will limit the transmission of Covid-19. 18. Most of the major cruise lines have already come out in support of this approach during their initial restart period. 7-10 days could be the standard until all processes & protocols are worked out, tested and show positive results. a. It will allow shorter periods of time between sailings for the ship to make adjustments as needed, as opposed to doing much longer cruises. b. Simply put, NO, unless you’re prepared to ask the same criteria from airlines, trains, buses, etc. 20. No, most often cabin companions are from the same family and therefore have been in constant contact with one another prior to sailing. a. No, however there should be designated cabins with private bathrooms for quarantine for crew if necessary to those showing or advising of symptoms of COVID. 23. No, however sanitization protocols (that are already in place in the cruise industry) would need to be followed on board to minimize spread and contact. This should be handled as any other contagious illness is already handled on ships. Since cruise ships have medical staff and facilities on board, they would make the decision about treatment, isolation, or possible disembarkation of the sick passenger. 24. a. Yes, for confirmed cases or known exposure situations a full refund should be granted instead of risking these guests to board the ship. b. No, only if they test positive should they be denied boarding. c. No, but the cruise line could grant the ability to reschedule for another date",,,

I have the upmost faith that the cruise lines will do everything within their powers to keep passengers and crew safe.  I willing embrace reduced capacity, social distancing guidelines, mask requirements, etc.  In most of the US we are all currently wearing masks when in stores, work, places of worship, salons/personal care services, restaurants (until seated and served), public transportation, etc.  As an adult I can make my own informed decision on whether I feel I want to take the risk to travel -- whether by my own car, plane, train, taxi, subway, Uber/Lyft, or ship.  I have faith in the industry and ship crew that they understand the need for extra precautions.  I have been on ship several times when medical treatment was required for a passenger, or a stranded refugee boat.  They are always provide care, treatment, assistance to those that need it with professionalism, discretion, compassion, and care.  If a plane can fly, if the subway can run, if an NFL football stadium can have 17,000 fans, and amusement parks are open - then a cruise ship should be allowed to sail.  It is up to us as to what risk we want to take.  That responsibility falls on me, the passenger that decided to take the chance and sail.  I am in the insurance industry and fully understand the liability and litigation risks involved.  Do people try to take advantage - absolutely!  That will happen with a pandemic or because someone trips over a chair.  You cannot remove all risk.  You can only allow the industry to do their best and allow us, the passengers, to decide what risk we want to take.I say all of this knowing I am a healthy 46 year old with no medical issues.  I am certainly not immune to any illness - but I am also not in a high risk category.  It is up to me, and only me, to know what risk I want to take and what is in my best interest.  Please stop removing my ability to make my informed decisions.  I want to sail.  My husband wants to sail.  Our friends want to sail.  Please allow us to and do not extend the no sail order any further.  ",,,

Due to obstacles with commercial travel , what pre-arrangements should cruise shipoperators make with the airline industry to accept crew and passengers from ships not affectedby COVID-19? It is unclear why cruise travelers should be singled out and treated differently thanother travelers and require special arrangements with airlines. Cruise passengers should not be considered differently than any  passengers whotravel through U.S. airports. Depending on the specifics of the final CDCrecommendations, cruise passengers may be more thoroughly screened and/or testedthan the others onboard a  flight. If travelers cannot be confident that they will be allowed to fly home after their cruise,they may not be comfortable booking cruise vacations and my business will continue tosuffer. The vast majority of cruises are booked through travel advisors. We are here for ourclients in the event of a trip disruption. During the pandemic, we spent countless hoursgetting our clients home safely from international destinations. .10. How should cruise ship operators address specific country travel restrictions that emergeas COVID-19 activity increases in geographical areas, such as:a. border closures preventing passengers and crew from repatriating?b. seaport closures preventing porting of ships?c. embarking passengers originating from countries with heightened COVID-19 activity? My cruising clients already understand that cruise lines may need to make itinerarychanges based on a whole range of criteria Theywould  support avoiding ports where the prevalence of COVID-19 wasthe determining factor. Travel advisors ensure that cruise passengers understand thatitineraries may change,  we work with our clients to address those changes. With so many of our clients cruising in the Caribbean, weather events during hurricaneseason is  perfect illustration of the fact that cruise ships are uniquely portable and can make last minute changes in  itineraries to avoid danger. Hotels or homerentals dont have that luxury. Im thrilled when a cruise ship with my clients onboardchanges course to avoid weather or security issues. In the future we will add COVID-19to the list of reasons to avoid certain destinations on the fly. If there is a regimen of testing prior to any passengers embarking on the ship, I dontthink its necessary for protecting my clients to exclude citizens of countries withhigher COVID-19 prevalence. Individuals carry the virus, not countries.16. What steps should cruise ship operators take to prevent the introduction of COVID-19 onto shipsafter resuming passenger operations?a. Should cruise ship operators deny boarding to passengers with COVID-like illness orconfirmed infection with COVID19?b. Should cruise ship operators deny boarding to passengers with known exposure to aperson with COVID19 during the previous 14 days?g. Should cruise ship operators transport and house passengers and crew denied boarding atthe seaport to avoid exposing the public? Cruise lines need to follow a host of new protocols to help ensure the safety of allpassengers.  Passenger about to board has a confirmed infection or exhibits COVID19 like illnesssubsequently confirmed as COVID-19, that individual should be deniedboarding. Travel advisors like myself should be the ones taking it from there  makingappropriate arrangements to house our clients in the  port area. After therelevant isolation or quarantine period ends, WE will arrange our clients safereturn home. This is our job, this is the reason  I strongly recommendtrip interruption and emergency evacuation for my clients. In my experience as a frequent cruiser, cruise line crew have always been great aboutreminding passengers to wash their hands and follow hygiene practices and caring forpassengers when becoming ill or injured.17. Should cruise ship operators plan to reduce passenger and crew loads to decrease the riskof transmission on board the ship?b. To what extent might reducing passenger capacity affect the economic viability ofcruise lines? Cruise lines are incredible innovators  almost every new ship launched has  moreenhancements to make the vacation more enjoyable. Im confident that by the timecruising restarts they will be able to accommodate the necessary social distancingrequirements to ensure passenger safety without reducing the numbers of passengersonboard. Reductions in capacity will surely adversely impact the economic viability of cruiselines, to what extent I cannot address. However, I do know how it will affect theviability of the travel agency sector. My income depends on booking a certainnumber of cruise passengers every year. If there are fewer passengers onboard itsless opportunity for me to earn a living. The CDC No Sail order since March has had a huge impact on the small business ",,,

We can't imagine taking a cruise in the current environment until there is a cure.  Even if we are careful, others won't be.1. I don’t see how it is feasible before there is a cure and/or vaccine.   To prevent COVID transmission, there would need to be a 2 week break between cruises, extensive cleaning, and quarantine period after air travel before boarding.   The early cruises in Europe already had new COVID cases, despite taking strong precautions2. Since COVID is not detectable in the first few days of infection, no cruise ship program could ensure everyone’s safety34a. Onboard to provide quick resultsb. Twice a week for crewc. extensive5. Crew members who depend on tips are likely to hide mild symptoms6. Need to provide some onboard intensive care unit beds, agreements with countries on/ near the cruise route to accept patients (with airlift options in critical cases)a. Pre-arranged contracts with appropriate hazmat level protection78. I can’t see this as viable without federal state and/or local resources.  At a minimum, consider having pods set up with full medical equipment and hazmat at each port, and with the expectation to quickly move extra pods (trailers or containers) to a severe infection site.  9. Airlines would need to maintain a list of questionable ports. Need arrangements for uninfected people from a ship which had a COVID outbreak.   In those situations, pre-arrangements should be made for quarantine periods, payment of lodging and other costs borne by cruise line.10a. Provide lodging and other expensesb.

CDC-2020-0087-3429,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Thomas,B,Comment from (name),"1.I believe cruise ship operators should clean surfaces multiple times per day.  I was on a cruise in February 2020, and it was the cleanest Ive ever seen a ship (this was my 3rd time on same ship, and it was NEVER dirty before).  I never felt ill.  They should also make sure air is circulated more frequently with outside air.  Have a more thorough health questionnaire, keep people away who are sick, and make language strong enough that it would keep those who are sick away.  Most wont travel if they are sick.2.Temp checks for crew is a must.  They should be tested before every sailing.  If crew is sick, quarantine them away from passengers and other crew.  Cruise ships have had a history of cleanliness and healthiness, so nothing really should change.3.They need to do what theyve always done.  Again, they have always had a good cleanliness record and keep other viruses and illnesses at bay.  Dont change anything with what theyre doing.4.I dont see it being very feasible at all.  If they wanted to test all passengers and crew every x number of days, that would be thousands of tests that theyd need to account for in storage.  So, no, that is not a good option.a.Testing should not be done onboard for COVID-19.b.Crew should be tested before each voyage.  Passengers should only be tested if theyve had symptoms within the two weeks before sailing.  If a passenger has never had symptoms, they should not get a test (per new CDC guidelines).c.I would say that the estimated cost of testing all passengers and crew would be $50,000-$150,000 per voyage per ship.5.I would say that they would need to make sure all information given by crew members is kept confidential.  If someone has symptoms, and are tested, the crewmember should tell their peers themselves, and not have the medical personnel tell them.a.I dont believe they should be encouraged to do so.  If they are a true medical professional, they should do it automatically at the next port.6.The ships should have capacity to hold 10% of total ship capacity in a quarantine if necessary.a.Ships should have medical care facilities they can work with in every port they visit.  Have them on standby when the ships come in.  If theyre needed, theyre there; if theyre not needed, great!7.The cruise line should have a hospital or care facility that they are working with in case they need to quarantine passengers or crew after returning to port.8.This would not be possible.  Ships are big vessels with 1500-6000 passengers.  Without help from Fed, State, or local resources, it cannot be done.9.Passengers and crew not affected should have no issue returning home.  So, there should be no pre-arrangements for this type of thing.  Airlines may require a negative test, but that could be the only obstacle.10.a.The ship would need to go to another port in order to get pax and crew home.  There is always a way to get them home.b.Ships would need to go to other ports (there will always be one open).c.Pax embarking from countries with heightened C19 activity would need a more thorough health questionnaire.  They do not need to be tested unless they have had symptoms within two weeks of sailing.11.If foreign seaports deny cruise ships, the ships simply change course.  This is not unusual and has been done for years.  If weather in a port is poor, and they cant dock, they try to get to another, or opt for another sea day.  This has been done for years! 12.By using the same companies and ways they did to get crew home earlier this year.  They know these companies now, so it should be easy to have them on standby in case something happens.13.I would say they need to continue cleaning, maybe step it up a bit.  Again, I was on a cruise in FEB. 2020, and I always saw crew cleaning.  This made me feel safer.  They would need to make sure air is circulated more often to help keep passengers safe.  Both of these things would be super effective, as C19 cant survive in the air or surfaces long (per CDC).  Cruise ships need to not implement a mask ordinance, they are not effective.  Weaves in masks are generally 10 microns or bigger, viruses are around 0.125 microns, therefore doing no good.14.Reduce capacity of ships to 50-60% at the start.  Keep sanitizing stations around ships in high traffic areas.15.Quarantine sick passengers, and let healthy ones have fun!",,,

CDC-2020-0087-3516,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Mark,Napolitano,Comment from (name),"My Wife and I have been operating a cruise group business for 4 years. Last year was the best year for our company. Initially when cruising was halted I totally agreed with the decision by the cruise lines and the CDC.At that time we knew very little about the virus and all highly populated venues were at risk.I remember the President in the early days stating that ""we will look after the cruise line industry. It is a very important industry"" Not sure what happened to that promise!After that the CDC first recommended people not cruise and then shortly after that they put a ban on all cruises from the USA. As I have said, at that time I agreed with the decision due to the lack of information.Today, this is no longer the case. My (our business) is all but destroyed. I see Las Vegas Casinos OPEN. I mention Casinos in particular because in my mind they are the most relevant comparison to a cruise ship.I work exclusively with Royal Caribbean. The reason is simple. I believe they run the most professional operation and the safest/cleanest in the industry. Royal Caribbean have accepted the CDC decisions and gone above and beyond to do everything humanly possible to insure that crew and guests travel safely when cruising is allowed to resume. Somebody at the CDC needs to make a decision to allow cruising to recommence ASAP. I am offended when my business lays dormant and yet I can head down to the Las Vegas strip and see casinos with literally thousands of people in them. The double standards are ridiculous. The only difference I can see is that the Casinos pay US taxes and the cruise lines do not. However, although I know no details I am sure that the cruise lines contribute billions of dollars to the economy of the United States. I think they employ hundreds (if not thousands) of Americans in the United States and contribute massive amounts of income for hotels, airlines, car hire companies etc etc.I hope the CDC will allow cruising to recommence as currently planned on November 1st.(slowly but surely of course). Let the cruise industry show the rest of the country how to best handle volumes of people as safely as possible. They have put more resources into achieving this than anyone else I can think of.Yours SincerelyMark NapolitanoCFO Card Player Cruises",,,

MSC has already resumed sailings and has not had any issues to date. Once the cruises resume, this will be a boost to the economy especially in the port cities where cruises embark. The CDC needs to be more proactive in working with the cruiselines to ensure that all safety protocols are met prior to resuming sailings. It is really unfair that the airlines can pack 100+ people on airplane like sardines, but the cruise industry has been shut down. Pretty much all travel has resumed as normal with the exception of the cruise industry and many small business owners and companies that partner with the cruises are suffering. US citizens can travel to Puerto Rico, Las Vegas, Mexico, and there is no restriction to travelling on a airplane at all and no social distancing efforts either. The cruise industry has been unfairly targeted and the CDC and cruise lines need to work together to resume sailings. People are happier when they are able to do the things they like and cruising a popular vacation choice that brings in revenues not just for the cruise line but for the small business and companies that partner with them.

CDC-2020-0087-3571,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Shannon,Stiner,"Comment from Stiner, Shannon","I work for a company in the field of travel event management, and a significant portion of our business includes events on Cruise ships. We have many years experience with several of the cruise lines, including Holland America Line, RCI, Carnival, Princess Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Lines, Viking, and others. It is my strong belief that cruise operations need to begin again as soon as possible. The cruise industry generates over $53 billion USD in economic activity in the U.S. and supports 421,000 American jobs. The cessation of operations is affecting countless lives and livelihoods, causing potentially irreparable harm. No other sector of the transportation industry has been put under the same stop order or level of scrutiny (e.g. public comment period, etc.). This seems an unfair and highly prejudiced approach. I do not believe that the CDC or any agency of the government should be choosing winners and losers, but using consistent standards across the transportation industry. As it has been put on the airlines and other modes of transportation to develop safe protocols, the Cruise industry should be given the same opportunity to do so and continue to operate. Below are answers to some of the specific questions in the public comment: 9. None, unless the same arrangements are made between other modes of commercial travel. Currently, there are no restrictions in place for crew and passengers coming from trains, motorcoaches or car services boarding airlines. 10. a. The travel industry constantly monitors all travel advisories for such an instance and can move to various options at a moments notice to accommodate both passengers & crew. 10. b. Cruise lines already have procedures in place for ports that are closed due to weather conditions. These same procedures and protocols can be used if ports are closed due to health regulations. 10. c. Since this info can vary by locations in a particular country, cruise lines should not single out countries with heightened activity but treat all embarking passengers with the same health protocol 16. Continue with normal cleaning, disinfection procedures. The cruise lines have already developed safe operations in response to Covid-19. a. Yes, they should deny boarding if the person has a confirmed infection or symptoms of Covid-19.b. No, cruise lines should not deny boarding if passengers do not have a positive test result or symptoms. c. Standard methods; visual (is this person sweating, does this person look pale, temperature check), audible (is this person coughing). It should not be any different than any other modes of transportation. d. Cruise lines should be held to the same standard as airlines and all other modes of transportation. e. See A-D f. Standard methods; visual (is this person sweating, does this person look pale), audible (is this person coughing). g. If cruise lines deny passengers or crew members boarding, they need to help them get home. But as mentioned before, cruise lines need to be held to the same standard as airlines and other modes of transportation that may deny boarding to a passenger. 17. The cruise industry generates over $53 billion dollars in economic activity annually and supports 421,000 American jobs. By reducing passenger and crew loads, this will have a massive impact on the American economy. a. This is not necessary with the increased screening prior to sailing. b. The impact of reducing passenger counts will have an extreme impact; ship operations overhead, onboard sales in all departments, tourism in ports c. The cruise industry already has safety and health standards that exceed other travel industries. 18. Most of the major cruise lines have already come out in support of this approach during their initial restart period. 7-10 days could be the standard until all processes & protocols are worked out, tested and show positive results. a. It will allow shorter periods of time between sailings for the ship to make adjustments as needed, as opposed to doing much longer cruises. b. Simply put, NO, unless you’re prepared to ask the same criteria from airlines, trains, buses, etc. 19. b. This should be worked out between the cruise lines and the port authorities as to what protocols best fit the circumstances in those ports, which is how this is always done already. 20.No, most often cabin companions are from the same family and therefore have been in constant contact with one another prior to sailing. a. No, however there should be designated cabins with private bathrooms for quarantine for crew if necessary to those showing or advising of symptoms of COVID. 23. No, however sanitization protocols (that are already in place in the cruise industry) would need to be followed on board to minimize spread and contact.

CDC-2020-0087-3569,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Lora,Ferguson,"Comment from Ferguson, Lora","I work for a company that creates group travel events on Cruise ships. We have been in the cruisebusiness since 1981. It is my strong belief that cruise operations need to begin again without furtherdelay, and for the following reasons:1. The Cruise industry as a whole regularly submits itself to health and safety inspections as per USand Maritime regulations.2. The Cruise industry as a whole has in place self-regulation protocols, as do the individual cruiselines for their ships.3. Cruise industry standards already exceed those of the regulatory authorities, and in the case ofCovid-19, this is no exception.4. The major cruise lines have developed extensive safe operations plans in response to Covid 19,which have been submitted for review by CDC.5. Covid-19 was transported and spread around the world on airplanes, not on cruise ships.6. No other sector of the transportation industry has been put under the same stop order or level ofscrutiny (e.g. public comment period, etc.). This seems an unfair and highly prejudiced approach. Ido not believe that the CDC or any agency of the government should be choosing winners andlosers, but using consistent standards across the transportation industry.7. While there were a few notable incidents where cruise vessels experienced Covid-19 outbreaks,in those few cases, the situation was exacerbated by local authorities in port countries who did notallow the sick passengers and crew to be removed for treatment, therefore endangering the otherpassengers and crew.8. At the time of those outbreaks, very little was known about Covid-19 and its transmission, andthere were no recognized therapies. Today, that is no longer the case as much more is understoodabout the disease, its affect on vulnerable populations, its 99.98% survivor-ability rate, as well asoptions for prevention and various therapies.9. Cruise lines are anxious to cooperate and resume their valuable and desired services as soon aspossible, and should be allowed to do so .10. Cruise lines should not be treated differently than other transportation systems.Below are answers to some of the questions:17. The cruise industry generates over $53 billion dollars in economic activity annually andsupports 421,000 American jobs. By reducing passenger and crew loads, this will have amassive impact on the American economy.a. This is not necessary with the increased screening prior to sailing.b. The impact of reducing passenger counts will have an extreme impact; ship operationsoverhead, onboard sales in all departments, tourism in portsc.

Most of the major cruise lines have already come out in support of this approach during theirinitial restart period. 7-10 days could be the standard until all processes & protocols are workedout, tested and show positive results.a. It will allow shorter periods of time between sailings for the ship to make adjustments asneeded, as opposed to doing much longer cruises.b. Simply put, NO, unless you’re prepared to ask the same criteria from airlines, trains,buses, etc.20 . No, most often cabin companions are from the same family and therefore have been inconstant contact with one another prior to sailing.a. No, however there should be designated cabins with private bathrooms for quarantinefor crew if necessary to those showing or advising of symptoms of COVID.23 . No, however sanitization protocols (that are already in place in the cruise industry) wouldneed to be followed on board to minimize spread and contact. This should be handled as anyother contagious illness is already handled on ships.

Having traveled via three (3) airline flights and five (5) different hotel stays since July 2020, I can not see any reason why cruising can not re-start under new basic health and safety protocols already implemented in the United States.  One just needs to look at the recent successful return to cruising in Italy.  With improved sanitation, face mask utilization, reduced capacity with  social distancing measures, proposed changes to the food-service lines, and temporary shore excursion control, I think cruising will be no more dangerous than an airline flight.",,,

The cruise industry was unfairly singled out by the CDC surrounding COVID-19.  While the news of Princess Cruises was front and center of the initial coverage, it was docked in the epicenter of where this virus originated.  Hundreds of other cruise lines/ships operated without issue and were never covered to place the sensationalism into perspective.  The cruise lines should ensure that surfaces are routinely cleaned all over the ship throughout the day.  Embarkation and debarkation should occur in zones with no walk-offs allowed.  Safety drills and training should be conducted via the in-room television instead of large group gatherings.  There is no reason for changes to the dining setup.  Buffets would be appropriate given hand sanitizer/washing stations at the beginning of the lines.  As long as a one seat is kept between parties, live shows should continue without disruption.  Cruise lines should be required to vet their onshore excursion vendors in order to ensure a safe transfer and return.  Crusing shoudl return without additional delay and retribution.",,,

Covid tests should be administered to crew and passengers before the start of every voyage (several quick tests should be available - just like Gov DeWine took prior to meeting President Trump).  Testing a random sampling of crew and passengers should also be administered after a port stop (5%?  10%?).  No ship mandated excursions - passengers should be able to get off the ship and enjoy themselves (responsibly).  I'm fine with limited seating in bars, lounges and theaters as well as food venues on the ship.  Self-service food options should of course (for now) be eliminated.  HVAC system should be improved ( we did so at our church), as well as increased and improved sanitation protocols implemented throughout the ship.  Medical facilities on the ship should also be reviewed.As a vaccine becomes available - the CDC should consider mandating this for cruisers - just like we do with other vaccines for school children.  We really need to get this part of the travel industry re-started.  If the cruise operators don't follow safety protocols to keep crew and passengers safe - passengers will vote with their wallets and shut down the line.   ",,,

CDC-2020-0087-3329,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Stephen,Harr,Comment from (name),"In my view, cruising will not be safe until everyone boarding the vessel (including ship staff) has been tested for COVID-19, and determined to be negative, immediately before boarding. With the current ""5-minute"" test protocol, this could possibly be implemented as part of the boarding process. Test results would be determined aboard the cruise vessel prior to sailing. Furthermore, every cruise vessel should have the requirement that passengers & crew be tested routinely, at least once during the second day of cruising and every time they have disembarked at a port and re-boarded.  The concept is that every vessel would be a ""COVID-19 free island"".Implementation of the foregoing process would affect the boarding and embarkation procedures, nevertheless, once boarded, there would be a greater sense of security and less need for social distancing and facial covers.  That could mean each vessel would accommodate a larger number of passengers for each sailing. Nevertheless, all of the other CDC guidelines concerning sanitation, and other protocols should continue to be followed.  The handling of passengers testing positive during the initial boarding process does present a problem to the local health officials at the port of embarkation. Local rules concerning quarantine and further travel would have to be observed. Nevertheless, allowing passengers who tested positive to board presents a clear danger to everyone else on board the vessel and I would not cruise were that to be the case.  The cruise operator as well as the affected passenger(s) should be responsible for any additional expenses necessary to accommodate those individuals.",,,

Based on what has already been disclosed, these precautions will be more comprehensive than what has been implemented in other related industries (e.g., airlines, theme parks, hotels), as well as other circumstances which have been allowed to return to operations with much less comprehensive plans (e.g., universities, restaurants, etc.).  It is time for cruising to incrementally return to service, and the CDC must be a part of the solution and not part of the problem.During the month of October, 2020, I would very much like the CDC to show a more engaged posture with the Cruise Industry, so that these companies can safely return to service.

My work has involved ships for 25 years and I have undertaken 500 cruises throughout my life.Cruise Ships should start again and can do so safely if certain protocols are followed.Testing all crew before they embark, once prior to travelling to the ship and once on the day they embark would be the logical option.Passengers should be tested prior to travelling to a ship and on the day of embarking.The port of embarkation should have a covid free zone around the ship, only people who have been tested and are negative can enter, be they passengers, crew, porters, officials etc. etc.Whilst there is no cure available cruising should be limited to private islands or beaches which have no interaction with other people, so no new contact can be made with people who may have the virus.Onboard the ships all measures should be taken to keep covid and other diseases at bay and neutralized. They should follow government guidelines or exceed them where possible.The cruises should be limited to 3 or 4 days in duration to begin with, a day at sea followed by a stop on a private island or beach, another day at sea and then the home port.Everyone onboard, crew and passengers alike should be tested prior to the ship returning to port, preferably on the Cruise Lines private island.Should any person develop the illness they should be quarantined on the private island in a medically supplied ship until such time as they test negative, then return via another ship or are flown home.This would insure no one would enter the USA with the disease, which is the main worry people and government have.The financial benefit of starting Cruise Travel again is felt not only by Cruise Lines but by the Local government, Airlines and Hotels which service the passengers who join the ships. A fair approach to covering additional costs should be taken between these parties.This is a basic framework which would ensure Cruising can start again and be safe for everyone.",,,

Fortunately we had a balcony cabin and the cruise was only 6 days and we remained mostly in our cabins until disembarkation.Princess did the wrong thing not only to themselves by trying to cover up what was occurring on there ships, but to crew and passengers. Which intern has come to bight them back in the bum. One asks How did Spectrum of the Seas in Australia in the peak of the NSW and Ruby Princess outbreak managed to do 2 successful 4 Night Cruises out to seas and back with no cases defected.?What protocol did the Captain, executives and crew take to make these cruises safe for Passengers and Staff?A ship is no different than a Cinema in fact a Cinema is worse no fresh air no windows and confined for 2-3 hours in a room with individual we dont know or what they have. Cruise ship have been able to control Norovirus and manny other outbreaks at the time of COVID no one knew about it or how it spread or what was needed to control the out break. So should Cruise Liners and Cruises pay the price NO.1. New Crew returning to Duty On a ship should Automatically go into 14 days quarantine in an established hotel in the Country they are boarding the Ship until fully cleared and tested.2. Passengers coming from high risk areas/ countries should not be able to board.3. Cruise ship start off locally with local passengers for 4/5 night cruise out to sea only.4. Buffet Bar passenger numbers restricted to time slots and proceed in the manner as if there had been a Norovis outbreak5 scheduled and limited passengers to events and theatre at schedule times6.

This is not a subject on which general public opinion is valid because the general public does not have the expertise to evaluate risks, etc.  The general public does not have education/information on the characteristics of viral reproduction, etc.  For example, general opinions on explosions or hurricanes are useless.  The explosive molecules, the hurricane winds, the virus doesn't care about public opinion -- it does what it is in it's nature to do.  Period.  If you are concerned about that, there is significant information about how to do it.The real question is can you as an organization do it and can you get all the 'moving parts' to do it, including guests?  Will there be a weak link somewhere that fails?  When cruising before, there is often someone who picks up a 'bug', and it gets transferred to the ship, and there ensues a bustle of trying to contain and eradicate -- with varried results.Crank officials, including uninformed MDs, often do not know enough about viruses to give useful opinions, i.e. 'herd immunity' theories.  The virus doesn't care about anything except 'fresh meat'.Altho my husband and I would love to be cruising again, I don't believe that it will be safe until there is a good vaccine, and everyone on board has an effective dose.

One theme that continues to emerge is the concept of a ""door to door"" strategy, beginning at the time of booking through the return of passengers to their homes.  Those of us in the Travel Agent community are expert in advising our clients about safety in cruising.Every ship has credentialed doctors and nurses onboard who are required to provide health declarations and detailing illnesses of individuals onboard to port authorities around the globe prior to ship's entry.

I can honestly tell you that I have never done anything on a cruise ship that would put me or others at any greater risk than what I did this week.  I boarded an airplane completely full of people and flew to Orlando Florida and went to Disney World.  I visited Animal Kingdom, Hollywood Studios, and Magic Kingdom.  I was closer to thousands of people than I ever would be on a ship in 90 degree weather.  Everyone was sweaty and hot, close together, with soaking wet masks on that Im sure did no good whatsoever.  On and off of busses, on and off of dozens of rides, standing next to all kinds of people.  Dont get me wrong, Disney is trying!  They have sanitizer, lines of distance painted everywhere, and remind you constantly to wear your mask, but there is no way it was any safer than a cruise ship.  In my opinion it was 100 times worse than any cruise ship where I can choose to keep my distance.  Then I went to a packed Orlando airport and flew in a full plane home again.  The point I am trying to make is this:  if airports, airplanes, and freakin Disney World is open then a cruise ship 50-75% full is way safer because you can choose to stay apart.  Yes we can wear masks, yes we can stagger embarkation/debarkation, separate people at dinner, etc, but to single out cruise ships to be shut down is rediculous compared to what I just did at Disney.  In my opinion cruise ships are being unfairly scapegoated compared to airports, airplanes, Disney, and everything else that is allowed to be operating.  Give us some rules and make sure they are enforced, but let them sail.  Go to Disney and see for yourself.  If they can do it so can cruise ships.  Time to sail.",,,

We should not underestimate the very possible detrimental concequences and impacts on the health of communities around the world.

This resulted in 21 deaths and almost 700 cases of COVID 19 around Australia, they played a prominent role in spreading of COVID 19 in Australia. It appears that  there was a considerable conflict of interest for Carnival to act responsibly and put people before profit. The subsequent irresponsible choices by Carnival put the whole of the citizens of Australia at risk.

Many of these activities have been reopened with protective measures in place, and are doing well. Let's take a look at the cruise lines now. There are measures the cruise lines can and are willing to take to keep their passengers safe. Norwegian Cruise lines is our family's preferred cruise line and we have been reviewing their plan to safely return to cruising. I would feel perfectly comfortable cruising again while taking protective measures. I myself can't stand masks but if I can return to the open water I will wear one in public area of the ship. I may be off base but the masks outside in a strong breeze would seem unnecessary, but I leave that to the professionals. Cruise lines will conduct screening often. Passengers who may be ill can be quarantined. Dinner shows can proceed with reduced capacity. Pools and hot tubs can be closed or reduced capacity with a reservation system. Shore excursions can be controlled with little to no public contact. I'd be willing to cancel our excursions that would bring us into the public. If we are able to go on our cruise Nov 29th we will take every possible means to avoid close contact with other passengers and protect ourselves. Some people are responsible people. Others like the increase in Daytona FL crowding the beach with no protective measures caused an increased spread there. I will protect myself and family from them.

Cruising is a big part of my life in many aspects. I believe that being on a cruise ship even prior to COVID-19 was safe & sanitary compared to the many places we choose to go in life on a daily basis! I have always seen workers working around the clock sanitizing everything possible and I firmly believe if you let the cruise lines open up they will go above and beyond to do what needs to be done to keep the crew & passengers safe and to give them some sort of normalcy in their life once again. Many of my customers, friends, & family are begging to be out there cruising once again.These cruise lines are changing air systems and planning to operate lower capacity and they are willing to do what it takes to get back out there but they need to be given the chance. If a customer cruises they know it is a risk but so is going to the dollar store or to go vote or protest or anything in life for that matter. We have one life to live and the people want to choose to sail let them and they know and understand what they will have to do to be able to sale whether covid testing prior to boarding temp checks whatever the obstacle might be let them be in charge of their life choices of whether they want to sail or not.

[prive information redacted] September 8, 2020 Maritime Unit Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1600 Clifton Road NE Atlanta, Georgia 30329 Re: Docket No. 2020-0087 - Comments from Steve and Gayla Hites, Skagway, Alaska To Whom It May Concern: We operate a small family-owned tour and entertainment company in Skagway, Alaska (population 1,000). We started our business in 1986. We are a vendor to the cruise industry: during the summer we employ up to 30 seasonal staff, and we have four year-around employees. 100% of our customers are guests on board the fleet of cruise ships that call into the port of Skagway during the short summer between May 1 and September 30. With the pandemic, and the CDC No Sail Order, the 2020 Alaska cruise season was cancelled. We have had no customer sales since the end of September 2019: we will have had no sales for the 2020 calendar year, and we now must navigate the winter months to get to a reopening of our business in May of 2021. We do not feel qualified to comment on the majority of the questions that you have posted. But we must comment on the need to rescind the No Sail Order between now and next spring to allow for cruise ships to return to Alaska. The ramifications of not doing this, and of the cancellation of the 2021 Alaska cruise season, will put the final nail in the coffin for all of Alaska's small tourism businesses. The local health and mental health issues for our small community, and for the entire Southeast Alaska region (which would reverberate throughout all of the Alaska, as cruise tourism is the main driver of the tourism industry in the State) would be nothing short of catastrophic. These should be of as much concern to the CDC as COVID. Unemployment, drug and alcohol abuse, child abuse, spouse and elder abuse, and all of the fallout from unresolvable financial hardship will have far-reaching consequences. Small communities will be decimated, with their populations leaving as they to try to find work elsewhere. In Skagway, cruise tourism is 90% of the town's livelihood. Without cruising, and its return, the town will die. The Skagway Mayor and Assembly are working with other Southeast Alaska communities to develop a regional approach to COVID mitigation. We want to have a regional response to the cruise lines' health protocols, and work cooperatively to reach a system that works for the cruise lines and local residents. We point out that in Europe, the cruise industry has worked closely with European health authorities and local port communities to establish workable protocols, and that ""big ship"" cruising has returned to Europe using these protocols with no health incidents to date. We believe that total passenger and crew embarkation testing - and the availability of continued rapid testing throughout a cruise - is central to a successful reopening. We also believe that an approved vaccine becoming available after the New Year will help smooth the way forward, and will help redefine how the CDC views the cruise industry's potential role in spreading COVID. We do refer to your Item No. 19, regarding Shore Excursions. We do not feel that Shore Excursions should be limited to only those offered by the ship, and that are operated in a ""bubble"" with guests not being allowed to take independent tours, and no guest contact allowed with the community outside the ""bubble"". Cruise lines should instead work with communities to develop ""best practices"" that reduce the risk of exposing passengers and crew to COVID. If cruise lines can keep their guests safe, so can port independent tour operators and local retailers. The financial health of our small communities depends on the health of our small businesses. Placing burdensome restrictions on Alaska businesses to facilitate the cruise industry undermines the overall local economy, and will create an atmosphere of resentment against the industry. Small business owners in the ports of call must benefit from the return of cruise ships. Unnecessary government health protocols will ultimately undermine this. And cruise guests really do want to experience and enjoy the full array of local offerings at every port. The future of our family business is quite literally in your hands. Our neighbors' futures, and the future of our town and the other small towns around us that rely on cruise tourism are there also. We ask that you please consider all of us in making your important decision. We respectfully ask that after due consideration you will drop the No Sail Order, and allow cruise ships to return to Alaska in 2021.Thank you for giving us the opportunity to comment on this critical matter. We are happy to answer any further questions or inquiries. Sincerely, Steve and Gayla Hits Skagway Street Car Company, Inc. [private information redacted]",,,
CDC-2020-0087-3380,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Colleen,OConnell-Diaz,Comment from (name),"Cruise ships should be held to the same standard as any other hospitality facility: hotel, b&b, etc. These floating hotels are no different than resorts. It is illogical and punitive to require cruise ships to have separate rules for cleanliness standards. Having said that, the industry wants to be smart, and desires to protect their consumers. Let them propose the standards and if they meet the thresholds that other hospitality and entertainment venues are following then they should be allowed to conduct business. Passengers understand the risks involved. A more robust health screening, a video muster, even a proof of clean bill of health prior to cruising would be acceptable to not allowing the industry to operate. The president holds rallies larger than the passenger capacity of some of these ships and doesnt require masks.  No one is stepping in to regulate those events. Stop penalizing this industry and let them bring forth their best plan.",,,

There must also be strict controls preventing gas, oil or any petroleum products from leaking or being dropped into the waters. There were Cruise ships full of tourists who were infected with Covid19 that were prevented from offloading sick passengers for many days and it caused spread of disease and deaths. This is unacceptable and there must be plans to better handle emergencies such as this from recurring.  There must be regulations put into place so the client aboard the ship and the residents who live in port cities are not endangered in this way again.There was a huge Government payout to the Cruise Ship industry and we Americans must be assured that in the future there will be plans to protect the health and wellbeing of your customers as well as the public and the environment.  This kind of disaster could recur and the confined situation aboard a ship is dangerous during a pandemic which could flare up again.   Before you allow Cruise Ship services to resume there must be a strategy for dealing with any situation that may arise.    Thank you for considering my opinion about the health of the people and the Ocean environment. ",,,

Install HVAC systems that eliminate transmission of COVID-19 and other airborne diseases.4. What is the feasibility of conducting COVID-19 diagnostic testing using FDA-approved or authorized laboratory tests on board a cruise ship?a. Should specimens be tested on board or should specimens be collected on board for commercial testing onshore?Yesb. How frequently should cruise ship operators test all passengers and crew?Prior to boarding and randomly at intervals based on the recommendations of medical professionals12. Given difficulties cruise ship operators have experienced when repatriating crew via non-commercial transportation, what preparations should the industry make to repatriate passengers or crew via non-commercial transportation after COVID-19 is identified on board?The fact that there are still crew waiting to be repatriated since mid-March is a humanitarian crisis.  The industry should prioritize and return all remaining crew before any return to cruising is allowed.16. f. Should cruise ship operators test passengers and crew pre-boarding? If yes, what should the testing protocol be?Yes; testing should be part of the check in process.  All passengers should provide proof of a negative test taken within two weeks of boarding as well.24. Because of the economic costs associated with cruising, some cruise ship passengers may be reluctant to cancel travel plans if they become ill or are exposed to COVID-19 or may try to hide symptoms of illness. Should cruise ship operators fully refund or provide incentives to passengers that:a. Are denied boarding due to COVID-like illness symptoms, confirmed infection, or known exposure?Yes; unless the passenger had a positive test in the previous two weeks to the boarding test.b. are denied boarding due to coming from high-incidence geographic areas?No; passengers can be safely isolated in their homes even in a high-incidence area.c. request last-minute cancellations due to COVID-19 concerns?Yes; this flexibility is necessary.  Some passengers (including this one) had to cancel Mar. 11, 2020, because of COVID-19 concerns, and I now have a cruise credit rather than a refund.  I do not see how I can use that credit safely within the expiration period given by the cruise company.  This puts an extreme burden on the consumer.

Prior to that, let me preface that I am in full support of the cruise lines resuming normal operations.  The economic and emotional destruction that this virus has caused is well beyond the scope of the physical impact.  I'm not trying to discount the loss of human life - it is unfortunate.  But we as humans have learned to accept risks and move forward in ways that ensure a balance between risk and happiness.  I could completely eliminate my risk from dying in a car accident by never driving again, but what type of life would that mean?  I would still be at the risk of someone else crashing into and killing me, but I accept that risk.  Other people on the road accept the risk that I could do the same to them.  The majority of the world should not be at the mercy of a minority number of people affected by this virus.  For those saying that cruises should not resume until a vaccine is available - that is an unrealistic expectation.  Do cruises check for a flu shot?  Vaccination against measles, chicken pox, TB, meningitis, or any of the dozens of other highly contagious illnesses?  Why is this any different?  And how long will it take before those vaccinations are readily available?  You're going to cripple the cruise industry and its dependents for another year?  They will not survive.",,,
CDC-2020-0087-3453,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Chantal,Hunt,"Comment from Hunt, Chantal","17. Should cruise ship operators plan to reduce passenger and crew loads to decrease the risk of transmission on board the ship?Yes, by at least 50% at first.  I believe one of the cruise company CEOs said they could still operate at a profit with even less than that.a. To what extent and for how long should cruise ship operators reduce passenger capacity?By at least 50% until the incidence of the virus on both ships and land falls below a certain number per 100,000, and/or until an effective vaccine is readily available to the public.  Then they will need to require proof of vaccination.b. To what extent might reducing passenger capacity affect the economic viability of cruise lines?Royal Caribbean’s CFO, Jason Liberty, said on the first-quarter earnings call that the newer ships in the fleet have to be at least 30% occupied to break even on an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization basis. c. Should cruise ship operators be required to provide scientific evidence that reducing passenger capacity will prevent transmission on board?I am uncertain how they could provide such evidence.  Perhaps the recent MSC cruises will provide evidence.  If we can extrapolate from airplanes: https://abc7.com/travel/what-are-the-odds-of-catching-covid-on-an-airplane/6382471/Low transmission risk.  According to his findings, based on short haul flights in the US on aircraft configured with three seats on either side of the aisle, such as the Airbus 320 and the Boeing 737 -- and assuming everyone is wearing a mask -- the risk of catching the virus on a full flight is just 1 in 4,300. Those odds fall to 1 in 7,700 if the middle seat is vacant.  ""Most things are more dangerous now than they were before COVID, and aviation is no exception to that,"" he tells CNN Travel.  ""But three things have to go wrong for you to get infected (on a flight). There has to be a COVID-19 patient on board and they have to be contagious,"" he says. ""If there is such a person on your flight, assuming they are wearing a mask, it has to fail to prevent the transmission.  ""They also have to be close enough that there's a danger you could suffer from the transmission.""  Barnett says he took all of these probabilities into account before determining an overall transmission risk.18. Should cruise ship operators decrease the length of voyages and, if so, by how much?Initial voyages should probably be limited to 8 days or fewer at first. Maybe even shorter.  However, being on a ship where extreme mitigation is being enforced may actually be a safer environment than some land-based places where masks and social distancing can’t be (or are not) enforced.a. How would decreasing the length of voyages affect the transmission of COVID-19 on board the ship and in U.S. communities?I don’t necessarily think it will.  See response above.b. Should cruise ship operators be required to provide scientific evidence that reducing length of voyages would decrease the risk of further introduction of COVID-19 to U.S. communities?I cannot think of a rationale for reducing voyage length as a mitigation strategy, so no.19. Should cruise ship operators limit shore excursions?Yes.a. What precautions should cruise ship operators take during shore excursions to prevent passengers and crew from being exposed to COVID-19?•First, limit voyages to nearby ports such as Bahamas, private islands, US ports or territories, or “cruises to nowhere”.•Organized, smaller excursions only.  No passenger-directed outside activities at ports.•Require masks while on excursion transit (tender boats, tour buses, etc).•Do not allow crew to disembark at any ports except the private islands where they are disembarking to perform duties.b. During shore excursions, how should cruise ship operators prevent transmission of COVID-19 into land-based communities?Same responses as above (a).20. Should cruise ship operators restrict the number of persons per room (e.g., maximum capacity of 2 adults per cabin)?No.  Families should be able to cruise together as usual. In addition, many families are staying safer by limiting their contacts to a select few close family members.  Therefore, even a room with four unrelated adults may already be roommates, or “Covid-pods” of people, and should be allowed to cruise together.a. Should cruise ship operators be required to provide single-occupancy rooms with private bathrooms for crew after resuming passenger operations?A good compromise would be double-occupancy and begin initial sailings 2 weeks after these individuals have been quarantined together.  This should be completely possible if 50% occupancy is utilized for the initial sailings.  This may require use of the lower passenger decks to house crew.",,,

Because of the economic costs associated with cruising, some cruise ship passengers may be reluctant to cancel travel plans if they become ill or are exposed to COVID-19 or may try to hide symptoms of illness. Should cruise ship operators fully refund or provide incentives to passengers that:a. Are denied boarding due to COVID-like illness symptoms, confirmed infection, or known exposure?Yes. Allow to reschedule for a later voyage without penalty.b. are denied boarding due to coming from high-incidence geographic areas?Yes. Allow to reschedule for a later voyage without penalty.c. request last-minute cancellations due to COVID-19 concerns?Yes, with set definitions of what the concerns may include. Allow to reschedule for a later voyage without penalty.25. Due to the costs associated with seeking medical care on board, and the likelihood that sick passengers will be isolated and their travel companions quarantined for the remainder of their voyage, how should cruise ship operators encourage passengers to notify the medical center when they experience COVID-19 symptoms?Add to contract that they may be banned from future cruises if dishonesty regarding symptoms is found.26. How should cruise ship operators decrease or eliminate the risk for COVID-19 transmission for both passengers and crew in the following group settings?a. Embarkation and disembarkation?Scheduled times spread out over more time than usual, allowing for social distancing and testing to occur in an orderly fashion. This may require later sail away times.  Use both/multiple gangways to embark and disembark.  For shorter voyages (4 days or less) require self-assist debarkation (no luggage service).  Strongly encourage this for longer cruises.  Perhaps offer free laundry service to encourage less luggage.b. Safety drills and trainings?Electronic muster drills (Royal Caribbean has already piloted this, I think). If not possible, increase the number of muster stations or assign them so that social distancing is possible (which decreased capacity should help with anyway).Do as much crew training electronically as possible. When not possible, allow for social distancing and require masks.c. Dining?Allow all menu items from MDR and/or specialty restaurants to be ordered as room service. No fee for room service, except for specialty items (like usual).Institute more times for set dining allowing social distancing among guests and crew.  For example, have 3 dining times for dinner, rather than 2, and assign by lottery, fully making this clear in the booking documents or some other place.  Tables can only be combined when members of the same immediate family or Covid-pod of people are sailing together, and then no more than 8 to a table, thereby allowing 10 total people in that general area (the 8 guests and two servers).  Servers are masked at all times.  Passengers only until food is served.  No large tables of mixed/unrelated groups of people.  Have an empty table between each table of guests.Buffets must have crew serve the food onto the plates (they started doing this on our March 2020 cruise, toward the end of the voyage—it worked well).d. Onboard entertainment events?Increase number of daily shows.  Block off groups of seats to promote social distancing. Require masks except for when drinking beverages; temporarily suspend large gatherings on the promenade, such as parades and parties.e. Shore excursions?Limit voyages to nearby ports such as Bahamas, private islands, US ports or territories, or “cruises to nowhere”.Organized, smaller excursions only.  No passenger-directed outside activities at ports.Require masks while on excursion transit (tender boats, tour buses, etc). Lower capacity on such conveyances.Do not allow crew to disembark at any ports except the private islands where they are disembarking to perform duties, or at the end of their contract to go home (assuming countries start easing repatriation restrictions).",,,

Disappointing, yes. but we soldier on! And it is necessary for everyone's safety, which at sea comes first. I believe continual temperature checking should continue while a passenger and crew is out at sea. I would rather country's with heightened COVID (needs to be determined by state of country) not be able to board the ship.Question #16: Response: Continue to monitor everyone's temperatures and have a solid questionnaire for every guest. I do not know enough about state regulations on the insurance...that being said some type of language within the travel insurance policy that would assist the passenger to perhaps quarantine at a hotel closeby. Some form of $$ to get reimbursed when submitted the claim. Keeping up a Safety check protocol is essential for cruise line success!A.  YesB.  YesC.  NoQuestion: #17: Response: Cruise lines are the ultimate for social time for families and friends. I believe because they are innovators of keeping people moving that their response to provide social distancing measures while on board will work out according to safety guidelines set forth. The issue with reducing the number of passengers is how long can a cruiseline maintain its longevity without the added revenue...something they will need to work out however having the reduced passenger in effect would bring more confidence initially when we are able to sail again. As a travel agency owner, limiting the number of passengers will also affect our business bottom line as many of our 65 travel advisors are already effected. This non-sail order needs to go away and put safety guidelines in place now!Question #18: Response: I do like the idea of having a range of sail dates at least in the beginning. Again safety protocols must always stay active, this will bring confidence to our clients.B. I do not think it should be ""required"" to provide this data.Question #19: Response: Shore excursions should be limited only if there is an issue with Covid in that area (city) or (state) (Provence) A.  Temp Checks and Questionnaire'sB.  To not allow anyone person off the ship who has a temperature or displaying symptoms.Question #23: Response: No. That is revenue lost by everyone in our tourism field that is tied somehow with a cruise. Our clients must have some form of travel insurance or interruption insurance either 3rd party or with the cruise line.Question #24: Response: A.  Yes Work out some type of plan prior to passengers sailing.B.  Yes, Depends on how ""High Incidence Geographic Area"" is defined.C.  Yes. If they or a direct family member has COVID, they should allow that cancellation.Another reason why as travel advisors we need to have the proper type of insurance either from the 3rd party or either cruise line that would be inclusive of this type of cancellation.Question #26: Response: I would say yes....if they stick to the protocols set in place by whomever and safety checks are done daily all should be fine.

Like the flu it's going to spread but unless you're within the at risk/immuno-compromised state, you will recover. If you're at high risk (Cancer, low immune system, blood disorders. not HTN, DM or prior CA HX), shelter and take precautions no cruising until a vaccine or cure is available. Precautions: Hand sanitizers and hand washing stations all over the ship (mandated prior to entering eating establishments), mandatory masks, increased filtered air ventilation to cabins, crew serving buffets. Now that faster testing is available (dependent on false positive rates), test often.2. Ensure frequent washing/sanitizing of hands, clean high traffic areas of the ship often. Pre-boarding and on-board messages/reminders of safe ways to contain spread. 3. In service messages on crew cabin TV's regarding proper cleaning procedures and daily tasks to prevent spread. Phone hotlines for ship/crew safety/health recommendations, suicide prevention task force. Frequent Testing for COVID.4.Very feasible now that there's a cheaper 15 min test hitting the market.      a. On board ship   b. Once on a 3 day, 2 on a day in addition to returning from excursion.   c. It is my understanding that there is a $5 test either out now or coming soon.5-    a. Inform the crew that if they report their symptoms, the individual and immediate crew members near them get tested/poss quarantine vs losing job and quarantine everyone.6. Quarantine in cabin and disembarked at next US port unless condition warrants immediate action. All passengers should be required to cruise with passport regardless if cruise is a closed loop cruise or not. This way passengers are not stranded in a foreign country with COVID.   a. In cases of needing immediate care, insurance should be mandated just like passports. Passengers can either purchase through the price of cruise or show proof of private insurance.7. I think that hospitals are more familiar with dealing with COVID patients now. Cruise companies, CDC, WHO and countries frequented by Cruise ships should have a pre-arranged set of protocols in place on how they will handle severe COVID cases in order to receive cruise ship passengers. I feel many countries want cruise ships back for their economy and would be more than happy to accommodate. 8. See above answers9. I feel that question is a little outdated now since I am answering this later in the pandemic. I feel the airline industry is more comfortable handling this now.10. a-b. All pre-arranged prior to leaving port. If they want the port fees and taxes for using their ports then they have to accept any and all conditions that may develop. Start finding ports that are friendly to the cruising industry.    c. Does the passengers test positive? Have passengers from areas with higher positive numbers have a couple negative tests prior to embarkation. (days/week?)11. Stated above, pre-arrange in a worst case scenario with protocols in place with that government/health system prior to cruising. If they deny after already accepting protocol, that port is suspended from receiving any cruise ships for a pre-determined time. 12. Crew insurance covers them/workman's comp type at closest port until recovered.13. See above ideas14. See above 15. See above16.    a. Yes if testing positive but if showing symptoms, you're going to be denying a lot of passengers. Especially with flu season coming. Perhaps if showing symptoms, hold them in a room until they have 2 consecutive negative tests. One in the morning and the other right before last boarding call.   b. How can you confirm that they were or were not in contact with a COVID patient. As a first responder I respond to PUI's and positive patients 2-3 times a week if not more. So, no first responders allowed to cruise???   c. Temperature checks and COVID test prior to boarding. New test coming out taking 15 minutes and cost up to $5 (Last I heard anyways).   d. See aboveMany of these questions have already been answered, skipping to new questions.17a. Start off with 50-75% capacity then progress in a month of good cruising. There are going to be positives on board. The question is going to be how does everyone handle it (Ports, airlines, other countries) have protocols in place prior to allowing cruises for when the positive cases develop. 18. Keep cruises the same lengths as before. If we can fly on a crowded airplane, stand in line at walmart we can stand next to each other on a cruise ship...19. Yes, shore excursions arranged by the cruise company only. 20. No, that's going overboard. People live in houses together without any problems. Interior, oceanview and balcony are all fine. Increase filtration in rooms. 24. They should allow full refund and cancellations if passengers are denied for health reasons at time of boarding or can show proof of COVID results.",,,

Temp checks for all on boarding day.c.Temperature checks on boarding day, tests for those showing symptoms.  Tests should not be offered to those who are asymptomatic (per CDC).

Crew, in this instance, should get all the same treatment as pax do on boarding day.f.Yes and no.  Pax with C19 like symptoms or who have had C19 symptoms in the two weeks prior to sailing should be given a C19 quick test.  Pax with no symptoms could be offered a test, but not required to take it (per CDC).  Temp checks for everyone on boarding day ONLY.g.Yes.17.Absolutely!  For the first few months, anyway.a.50-60% capacity for the first 4-6 months or so.  Shorter period if it goes well.b.It may affect their economy a bit, but its only temporary.  The capacity should be 5-10% above the break-even point for them.  If break even is 45% capacity, then cruise ship capacity should be 50-55%.c.No.18.Not fully.  Sail less 7+ night sailings, and more 3-6 night sailings in the beginning, see how it goes.a.It would allow less time for people to be together to spread the disease.b.No.19.They should not limit the number of excursions.  Keep what they have, but keep numbers a bit lower.a.Shore excursions should have a very strict, pre-planned route and pax need to stay with the group (see what MSC Cruises put into practice).b.See 19A, keep pax in a close bubble and keep them out of communities.20.No, most people who travel in a cabin are family, and according to CDC guidelines as long as a family lives in the same household, they can be together.a.Not if crew is tested regularly, and tell medical staff if they feel ill.21.An always on-call councilor would be the best bet here.22.If pax want to take an end of cruise excursion, same rules apply as shore excursions, they need to keep very close to the excursion route, then go to the airport.  Those pax going home by car or plane need to get where theyre going.23.No!  Extra cleaning needs to be done, and make sailaway time later if needed.24.a.Absolutely!  But, again, the health questionnaire needs to be more thorough and available online 2 weeks prior to sailing.b.Pax do not need to be denied boarding due to coming from a high C19 geographic area, but if they were, then yes.c.Yes.  Royal Caribbean is already doing this.25.The same way they do with other illnesses currently.  They shouldnt have to encourage anyone to seek medical help if they feel ill.  Dont make it public knowledge that someone has C19 onboard.26.a.Staggered embarkation and debarkation.  Royal Caribbean has time slots that one can choose from.  Those may have to be more enforced.b.Again, Royal Caribbean has a new electronic muster coming soon.  That must be the way moving forward.c.Have more dining times available, less tables per dining room.d.Fill every other seat if necessary.  Families can sit together.e.See 19A.27.Honestly, I cant really see any benefits from all of this.  These are going to be very expensive measures to put into place for a virus only accountable for 182000 deaths in a country with 330 million people (0.0005%).  If things are kept clean, and people are responsible (eg: dont travel if sick, stay home, wash hands, etc) then nothing else would need to be done!28.I dont believe thats necessary.  Look at things in the past, there were very few outbreaks on ships, so, if people are smart and responsible, this can be handled like norovirus, the flu virus, and any others that happen.I do hope these comments are taken into consideration, and there are some things that should change, but not so much that cruising would no longer be fun.  No one wants to go on a ship to be constantly masked up, temperature checked, and C19 tested every day (or several times a day, regarding temp checks).  A cruise is supposed to be a getaway from the world, and if the regulations for passengers becomes overbearing, we will stop cruising, and the cruiselines will go bankrupt because of all of the regulations.  So, please, Im begging you, for cruisers everywhere, be safe, but be smart about it, and dont make our vacations unbearable!  Temp checks at check in are a good idea; C19 testing for those who are symptomatic or who have been two weeks before sailing is a good idea.  Masks dont work, and dont need to be part of this equation.  Temp checks several times a day is not necessary.  C19 testing for those who are asymptomatic is not necessary (per CDC).",,,

I would like to say that each member of our society needs to be responsible for themselves.  I do not want to wear masks on vacation.  I do not want to worry about social distancing on vacation.  I go on cruise vacations to meet people and make new friends.  If I decide to place myself in a group of people, that is on me.  If someone is afraid of getting sick, then they should take care of themselves and not bring it to the doorstep of others.  That being said, I would like to see the cruise industry resume.  There is no reason for hotels and restaurants to be operating (not to mention planes, trains and the like) and not let the cruise industry resume.  Let us get on a ship.  Even if there is a reduction of ports, or even letting us sail around with no particular place to go, we still want to cruise.  Do not continue to overstep by taking responsibility for the actions of every person.  Let me take care of me.    I have not been exposed.  I live in a rural area.  We don't have many cases.  Stop punishing the many for actions of the few.  Let us sail. Let us go home when we return. Let us live our lives.  We can not continue to live in fear.  ",,,

Currently, it would be helpful if correct, up-to-date closures were easily found on line's websites.Question 16 There should be mandatory health screenings through all of 2021.  Passengers should have a negative test to hand in  and have their temperature checked.  All before boarding.Question 17 Yes, cruise lines should reduce the number of passengers, thru all of 2021, by 10% up to 40%.Question 18  Cruise lines should not limit the length of voyages. We think the longer, the better.  Also do not limit regular shore excursions.  Local home or school visits should be eliminated in 2021.  Over land excursion that require a night away from the cruise might need to be eliminated.Question 23  Do not cancel the whole cruise for all the passengers, just isolate the sick person and the immediate contacts.  High speed testing could be of great help. Question 24 - Yes, refunds should be given, especially if a person is turned away at the embarkation dock.  A generous cancellation policy may encourage honesty.Question 25 - When people are forced to be quarantined for the full 14 days, a small refund for each day should be given - either cash or credit.Question 26  Mainly the cruise lines must enforce social distancing.  a. - passengers should be given strict times to embark and stay out of the terminal until their time has come.  b. - There can no longer, in 2021, be a single mass safety drill. Masks must be worn.  Maybe 1/3 of the tenders could be called at any one time so people could spread out along the deck.  Passengers could just check in at the assigned tender spot and then go another place for the information.  c. - Passengers should ALL have an assigned time for dining at night so there is less mingling.  Have three(3) assigned seatings and space out the tables.  d.- Have three shows each night so seat can be spread out.  Bars should have a published capacity limit.  e. Shore excursions should be limited in size so that buses are not full.  Hand sanitizing station at bus door.  Temperature check upon returning to the dock. ",,,

CDC-2020-0087-3423,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,E,J,Comment from (name),"I am a public health professional and cruise line fan. Although I have not been on dozens of ships like some other commenters, I have been on 5 cruises of varying lengths, sizes, and locations. While I think we need to proceed incredibly cautiously with the reopening of cruising, I find it concerning to see so many hateful and inaccurate portrayals of cruise lines here in the comments.I feel that while there are many faults, cruise ships have been unfairly mischaracterized as the source of the coronavirus, as we see in the media and here in some of these public comments. In my experience, crew members frequently go above and beyond when cleaning public areas and frequently requiring hand sanitization before entering any venue.While I am not personally ready to cruise right away, I would be ready to step aboard a ship in 2021 with some simple and practical guidelines to reopening their business safely -- as we've seen outlined in guidelines for reopening businesses in states such as California and New York. First and foremost, like all other businesses, cruise lines should begin operating at a reduced capacity (at least 50% to begin with). I would be supportive of a rule that cruise lines can only book staterooms with an exterior balcony attached, allowing for fresh air available at any given time.I know that pools and other public areas are popular spots for tourists on the ships. I think in addition to social distancing requirements, I would recommend reopening with requirements that guests must pre-book spots at a pool, bar, restaurant, etc ahead of time. These would be time-limited and based on reduced capacity for each. As far as buffets (also popular), I think they would operate under these same advanced booking guidelines and would no longer be self-serve. For crew members, I believe they should have access to rapid/reliable COVID-19 testing on a daily or nearly daily basis, with paid sick leave if they need to be quarantined. For guests, I expect that everyone coming aboard would be tested with a rapid test as they arrive at the cruise port, or be required to produce the results of test taken 48 hours before boarding. My preference would be testing on board. If reasonable, I think guests should be expected to be tested at least weekly or every other day while on board, with cruise lines providing reasonable quarantine and contact tracing plans in the event that crew or guest member is positive.As far as masks, I believe everyone should be required to wear a mask when they are in the interior of the ship where there is no access to fresh air (such as a bar, restaurant or theatre), only taking it off when they are not eating and drinking. Guests should be required to wear masks whenever they are moving around the ship (interior or exterior) when they expect to pass within 6 feet of another party or person. While they are enjoying outdoor activities, they may remove their mask when stationary and socially distanced from others (such as sitting by the pool). I think the CDC should require or ask cruise lines to provide detailed plans safeguarding crew members who will be required to enforce these various rules. All guests need to read, acknowledge, and agree to any new regulations before they are allowed on board.Although currently not allowed under U.S. law for ships not flagged in the U.S., I see benefit in permitting so-called ""cruises to nowhere,"" whereby a ship is allowed to board and depart a U.S. port but does not visit any additional ports of call along the way. This actually could be a good testing ground for many new protocols with a greatly reduced (<50%) capacity.While there are promising vaccines on the horizon, I don't think reopening businesses should be dependent on a successful vaccine (or coronavirus treatment). Many of the protocols recommended above are based on how we know the virus is spread and rooted in evidence-based research aimed at preventing transmission. However, as cruise lines are private businesses, I would be in favor of requiring passengers that wish to board to provide proof of having received a vaccine, once and if it is widely available.",,,

All passengers must have travel insurance which currently covers illness in a foreign country and travel after treatment, therefore governments are off the hook.  If insurance companies will not cover covid 19 illness then none of us would cruise.  Cruisers are people of means but no one could charter private medical flights.  There must be universal agreement between operators, customers, crews, ports of call, hosts countries of those ports: that here is the list of rules covering illness, treatment, and repatriation after treatment and violations would carry stiff penalties.  Tell me I am covered for illness and can get treatment and home and the costs involved.(12) see 9-11(13) We have seen Oceania's protocols which seem appropriate.

The Casino must reduce the capacity according to the reduced capacity of the vessel and in case some gamble games reduce the limit of a participant or are sure the keep the distance.• Shore excursion as written before can be done in safety only in accord with the local authority and all the excursion must be organized by the cruise operator (no free excursion)One suggestion is to organized travel packages in cooperation between Cruise lines, airlines, and hotels, in order to ensure that every aspect of the travel can be followed, from the city is departing the customer until they arrive onboard the vessel.That will reduce the possibility that the virus can be meet during the transfer and in order to keep the customer to meet other people that are not part of the cruise.For example:If we have passengers that come from one city different from the home port of the vessel, this costumer can be organized in a group of people that will test before the will embark on the airplane.when they arrived on the port of embarkation can be tested again in this way every customer Is test twice before the cruise.If the passenger they come from a different nation of the port of embarkation they can be tested before they embark on the airplane, if they arrive the same day they will pass the second test again in order to have a double test.If in case they arrive the day before the passenger they can be accommodated in a hotel in “short quarantine” in order to avoid any contact with local people and keep them safe, and the day of embarkation does the second test.This clearly is an example that in which way we can work, there are many options we need just to look for them, we need the will and strength to make it happens.

Through their undercover investigation in collaboration with Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Stand.earth found that air pollution on the deck of cruise ships is worse than some of the world's most polluted cities.Cruise ships should be required to shift to cleaner fuels and stronger filters to reduce ultrafine air pollution that can cause higher rates of asthma and cardiovascular disease which the CDC itself has indicated are associated with increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19.Cruise ships have been a major vector in the spread of COVID-19, and must be required to do more to protect passengers and staff both from exposure to the virus, and pollution that is likely to increase the health impacts of COVID-19.",,,
CDC-2020-0087-3486,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Mark,Anonymous,Comment from (name),"COMMENT FOR:Docket No. CDC-2020-0087Most cruise lines have operated for years with high standards of cleanliness, as well as high health & safety standards for their guests and crew.  As a long time cruiser, I have never sailed on a cruise where I have become ill.  My parents have sailed even longer with the same outcome.  No illness.  I am confident that most cruise lines take the health and wellness of their guests very seriously.  Cruise lines are taking additional steps to implement the standards that have already been approved by the CDC for land based establishments. (i.e. Restaurants, Amusement Parks, Resorts, and other Public Spaces)  The wearing of masks and social distancing, while these are already planned measures by cruise lines, are two of the easiest for cruise lines to implement.  The use of rapid testing of passengers before a passenger is permitted to board a ship, as well as expanded cleansing and disinfecting of ship's spaces, are all measures that are or will be implemented when a cruise line chooses to resume its cruise operations.  While this virus is still a question, there are still other viruses out there as well.  The ""entire"" cruise industry has never been shuttered because of a ""single"" cruise ship that was affected by Norovirus.  I have been onboard a cruise ship where someone had to be quarantined.  As a result of the response of the medical staff and crew onboard the ship, at no time was I concerned for my personal health.  As a former Firefighter/EMT I could plan for everything possible, but I know that even the safest plans can still result in a negative outcome.  The desire to explore is in all of us.  To deny us the opportunity to explore via a cruise ship denies us the opportunity to utilize perhaps the safest form of global exploration.  With the current health & safety standards in place, as well as the expanded measures that are being implemented by cruise lines, I believe the future of the cruise industry is brighter and safer than ever before.  I am confidently looking forward to my next cruise in the very near future. Thank you for this opportunity to express my thoughts.",,,

I have cruised perhaps 500 days total over a 40 year period.  Cruising is a challenging environment for dealing with infectious illness.  Based on my own experience I believe many people go ahead and take a cruise when they know that they are ill and probably shouldn't.  The problem is that people have invested in their planned vacation and often have no protection from the loss of their vacation money if they cancel.  To return to safe cruising the cruise lines need to include cancel for any reason at anytime policies with full credit.  If a traveler is ill with a full credit policy then they won't even travel to the port at all reducing risk in the whole transportation gamut. For Covid until there is a proven highly effective vaccine, Cruise lines should require a very recent negative test before boarding and a rapid test for all passengers on the day of boarding.  Crew members need to be provided very frequent tests with immediate effective quarantine, preferably off the ship, when there is a positive test.  Other policies that might merit consideration would include general health screenings to preclude passengers taking cruises with health conditions which make them high risk for serious consequences from infectious disease.  Cruise ships are not well designed for social distancing so the best policies will be policies that assure the passengers an crew are free from infectious disease.  Probably cruise lines should also require passengers have appropriate current immunizations such as flu shots.",,,

CDC-2020-0087-3481,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Angela,Sipka,Comment from (name),"I know that Covid 19 can be dangerous for some, I am one of those.  My thoughts are that the CDC seems to be singling out the cruise industry. Do the same type of restrictions apply to air travel, train travel, bus travel, theme parks, or all inclusive vacations to Mexico. Why not ask for public opinion on any of these venues. I think cruising should resume in November, especially if a positive treatment or vaccine is available. Cruise lines(CL) have asked the CDC for requirements to start travel again, CDC has not responded. Some CL hired their own professionals to review/make plans for safe cruising.Those of us who cruise know there are many risks involved in cruising. I hope that very soon there is a vaccine available for everyone, but if not I am sure many cruisers would still travel, and sign a risk statement. This could include something requiring that if they have any symptoms or develop positive Covid they agree to seek treatment and quarantine in the arrival port. Make it illegal if they do not. Cruisers will be taking chances, but they also take chances when flying, shopping, working, or caring for children going to face to face schooling. CL should limit capacity initially I am not able to say how much but I think 60-65% of passengers even more if the CL have good plans and requirements in place. One of those fast tests just before boarding the ship would allow the ships to deny boarding for those who test positive. However they probably would have flown to the departure city and already exposed people. So just giving CL these restrictions is very unfair. Perhaps a test for those who want to fly should also be required other than a temperature check? Temperature checks before entering the terminal, health questionnaires, and masks should be required. Testing/quarantine of crew 14 days before beginning the cruise. Scheduling boarding/departure times to avoid a large crowd should also be required. I feel wearing a mask inside any of the cruise ship areas should be required, but if everyone has been tested it would not really be needed unless someone gets off the ship and returns. Ventilation on the outside decks would allow this requirement to be relaxed. CL should improve their ventilation on inside decks and rooms or improve the filters they use. CL should have medical care available without cost to check for any Covid  Symptoms and adequate rooms to isolate someone if needed until they can be taken off the ship. I would not allow buffets to run again as before. For now staff could serve food from the buffet. Toilet seat covers that automatically replace themselves when flushed would work. Automatic doors into and out of the bathrooms, or a staff to open/close the door wearing gloves. Distancing in theaters and dining rooms is needed.  Although I would like to cruise I feel for the many people whose jobs are related to CL industry. This is not a health problem but could be if enough people lose their jobs and have difficulty with their ability to care for themselves financially and possible with their mental health. My question for the CDC is how many people, what percent, have developed the Covid 19 virus on all ships and how many people cruised on all ships during that time, versus the same numbers of people on land.

What mental health services should cruise ship operators provide to crew and passengers during quarantine or isolation?They could contract with providers of EAP-like services, which are short-term telephonic interventions designed to get a person through a tough time.  They should have maybe a psych nurse on staff (who can also provide medical care), for prolonged staff isolations.22. What precautions should the cruise line industry take to safely disembark passengers and crew without transmitting COVID-19 into local seaport communities?Frequent rapid testing of passengers, including on disembarkation day.  23. Should the cruise line industry immediately cancel cruise voyages if COVID-19 cases are identified on board or after disembarkation?Not necessarily.  There should be some “acceptable” level of positive tests, since the majority of people have little or no symptoms.  Even in my very small rural community (which also has a small tourist industry during the summer), there are a couple cases per week. This should be transparent, however, and passengers on subsequent voyages allowed to cancel without penalty if they are not comfortable with the current rate of infection aboard a vessel.24. Because of the economic costs associated with cruising, some cruise ship passengers may be reluctant to cancel travel plans if they become ill or are exposed to COVID-19 or may try to hide symptoms of illness. Should cruise ship operators fully refund or provide incentives to passengers that:a. Are denied boarding due to COVID-like illness symptoms, confirmed infection, or known exposure?Yes. Allow to reschedule for a later voyage without penalty.b. are denied boarding due to coming from high-incidence geographic areas?Yes. Allow to reschedule for a later voyage without penalty.c. request last-minute cancellations due to COVID-19 concerns?Yes, with set definitions of what the concerns may include. Allow to reschedule for a later voyage without penalty.25. Due to the costs associated with seeking medical care on board, and the likelihood that sick passengers will be isolated and their travel companions quarantined for the remainder of their voyage, how should cruise ship operators encourage passengers to notify the medical center when they experience COVID-19 symptoms?Add to contract that they may be banned from future cruises if dishonesty regarding symptoms is found.",,,

CDC-2020-0087-3422,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Harriet,Hernandez,Comment from (name),"We believe that cruising may begin again, on a trial basis, with the following protocols in-place:  1) Start with a 30% occupany rate to ensure social distancing is possible.  Increase the percentages later if the initial sailings remain Covid-free.  Masks worn by everyone during the boarding process.2)  RAPID Covid-19 testing for all passengers and crew members to ensure the ship begins its trip Covid-free.  All passengers pass through a UV light system to help sanitize them and their carry-ons.  The big problem is asymptomatic Covid-carriers. Please provide RAPID testing to keep them from endangering others.If an individual passenger doesn't have a mask, then provide one.  Masks are a biggie.  If people refuse to wear masks when boarding the ship or later during the cruise, then they must be denied entry at initial boarding, and/or off-loaded at the first port after departure if the incident occurs after departure.  if they have medical issues that prevent them from wearing masks, then no cruising.3)  All suitcases loaded from the dock are sanitized with a fogging agent or by running them through a UV light system.4)  Maintain the Covid-bubble you've created by ensuring that any excursions, if allowed at all, leave the ship with a Covid-vetted vendor.  All passengers must remain with the vendor until the excursion returns to the ship.  Any discrepancies result in the passenger/s being denied re-boarding.  I am in favor of sail-at-sea with no stops for the initial sailings, to maintain the Covid-bubble you've created.5)  If there are stops for fuel and/or food deliveries, then contactless steps must be taken to keep the virus off the ship.  Sanitize the cargo coming onboard, and receiving crew members must wear masks, face shields, and gloves until the cargo/food has been sanitized.6)  No self-serve buffets; passengers ask a food specialist for some food and it is placed on a plate and handed to them,  along with utensils. Serving crew members should wear masks, face shields, and gloves to keep them safe.No group utensil/plate dispensers where passengers pick up rolled silverware/plates.   No salt/pepper shakers on the tables.  All the tables in the dining rooms/buffet areas adhere to the 6-foot rule for social distancing.  Passengers wear a mask in transit to and in transit from their tables for inside dining.  The mask comes off to eat and drink only.  If the dining venue is outdoors, the mask requirement need not be as stringent, but the 6-foot distance between tables remains in place.  Bars?  No chairs at the bars; people come up, get their drinks, and then move away from the bar.  Any tables associated with the bar must be placed 6 feet apart.  Smoking probably needs to go away for awhile as well.Casino?  Good luck with that.  To maintain 6-foot spacing, at least every other machine must be shut off and the chair removed from in front of it.  Probably need to remove all chairs from the machines and the casino bar.  No midnight snacks for gamblers, unless you provide grab-and-go bags for them.  No smoking.  Why?  People love to blow smoke out on the exhale.7)  Gym/salon amenities are appointment-only to ensure social distancing.  Either that, or place heavy-duty plastic dividers between each piece of gym equipment and/or salon chair.  Sanitize all equipment before and after use.8)  Have sanitizer machines all over the ship.  All bathroom soap dispensers must have soap in them and be replenished daily.  If possible, hand sanitizer should be available in the cabins as well.9)  Rooms must be fogged with an anti-viral agent to eliminate germs from the prior occupant, unless you do the following:   When following the low-capacity rate, spread the 30% of passengers out over the ship on cruise # 1.  The second cruise, use rooms that were vacant during the prior cruise.  The third cruise, use rooms that were unoccupied during the first two cruises.  You'll have10% left over, possibly as quarantine rooms in the unlikely event you'll need them.Give the passenger the option to request that towels and toiletries be left inside their doors.  They can leave the dirty/wet towels/trash bags in the same place for pickup.  During the cruise, the room stays ""clean"" of Covid-19. and the crew members have less exposure to Covid.  10)  Production shows, etc.  My favorite thing on the ship.  Show them on TV so people can watch the shows in their rooms.  Bingo. Social distance the players.  If you can do that and they wear masks, it may  work.At sea pool events?  Outdoor hot tubs probably should remain closed.  Decide if you're going to put chlorine in the pools.  If you can't or won't, then they should be closed during the cruise.  Hopefully people will like  walking around the ship and exercising.  Pools are traditionally the hot spots during a cruise.  If you can figure out how to get drinking folks to social distance, maybe it will work.",,,

CDC-2020-0087-3409,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Bert,Rodriguez,Comment from (name),"To begin I'll comment specifically on key inputs to the RFI  #10 - Cruise ship operators should update itineraries to country's that have had success in limiting the spread of COVID-19 or those that have a medical system that is well suited to taking care of the general population that may become infected. b. Seaport closures are nothing new to cruises who have routinely needed to update their itineraries at the last moment for closures due to weather, disease, or political issues. The cruise industry is well suited to making these last minute updates. c. Passengers embarking from areas of increased Covid activity should be treat the same as if there was increased activity from any other type of communicable disease. A body temperature check should be added to embarking procedures and those determined to be running CDC determined temperature that classifies a fever should be singled out for a rapid test. #16 - Cruise ship operators should continue their exhaustive ship sanitation procedures to prevent introduction of COVID-19 onto ships after resuming operations. In addition, simple temporal temperature checks can at least ensure that symptomatic patients of communicable coronoviruses and flu's are identified and provided the opportunity to reschedule their travel. I do believe that the cruise industry SHOULD NOT FORCE the use of masks considering masks that cannot be routinely cleaned have a greater propensity for harboring microbes and causing infections of all types. g. Cruise ship operators should be required to transport crew denied boarding due to illness. #17 - While I don't think it should be a long term solution and the efficacy of such an approach is questionable, I do think the cruise industry is capable of reducing capacity and operating to profit if that's the only way the CDC will allow this to occur. #18 - The length of voyages should not be decreased as once the passengers and crew are onboard there's not too much of a difference between exposure whether its a 4 night cruise 7 or 9 night cruise. The cat is out of the bag at that point.b. Cruise ship operators should only be required to provide scientific evidence to prove that a longer cruise does not increase the risk of covid infection if similar airline, hotel, and amusement (Disney) industries have to provide the funds necessary to conduct that type of study. #19 - Shore excursions should only be limited in accordance with restrictions set by local authorities. In dealing with Covid cruise line policies it's important to remember that one size fit all approaches will fail and be a detriment to passengers and local economies alike.  Local areas that serve cruise ship passengers would not be well served to assume the PERCEIVED risk of accepting passengers but not see the return in profit if cruise lines mandated cruise line only excursions. Instead the cruise industry that enforce such policies earn all monetary gain and do not allow for return of economic viability to countries that depend on the return of the tourist revenue source. #23 - CRUISES should not be immediately cancelled due to Covid diagnosis following embarkation. These should be treated like a current day NOROVIRUS  or flu case monitored closely for community spread on the ships and react accordingly. #24 - Two options or a combination should be considered as far as holding cruises responsible for denying patrons due to Covid like infection. The options include:#A I think initially it's reasonable that purchasing a cruise requires purchasing an added cost of a ""Covid"" insurance. Should denial of boarding due to covid occur the insurance will be used to protect the cruise purchase. #B If somebody is denied boarding for any covid related reason the cruise line should offer a full credit (not refund) toward a future cruise. The passenger will be responsible for travel cost incurred and all of their own medical care. Combining this with option #A would cover such travel and medical costs in the case of denied boarding. #26 - Cruise operators should follow local covid directives and laws when allowing shore excursions. The cruise industry in general has always had to adhere to cleanliness and safety standards which are scientifically quantifiable and easily casually observed. The cruise industry, fairly or not, seems to have to exceed all other travel industry wellness standards. There is no greater travel industry comparison to the CDC vessel sanitation program. As a cruise consultant who's income in suffering as a result of the industry shutdown it's unfortunate that other similar industries, including prominent amusement parks and casino resorts are allowed to operate and not the Cruise lines. There are tens of thousands of cruise industry related professionals who's livelihoods have been all but erased due to what seems like a somewhat arbitrary targeting of one of the best rated cleanest forms of hospitality available within the cruise ships.

As a member of the Travel Advisor community, specializing in selling cruises to families for their vacation, I want to comment on some of the questions posed by this Request for Information document from the CDC. There are some questions that I do not have sufficient knowledge or training in, so I am only going to answer those to which I can address.Cruise Sales make up roughly 80-85% of my business, so while people are slowly getting out there to travel within State, to neighboring states, and to Mexico and the Caribbean, that is all Land-based travel, which I do little of. Or rather, my Destination specialty for Land-based travel is to Australia and New Zealand, neither of which is possible to travel to right now. I am an Independent Contractor and my pay is 100% derived from commissions, so right now, Im mostly working for free. Ive processed nearly 100 cancellations this year alone, and the year is not over yet. I help my clients decide between a cash refund or a Future Cruise Credit, the follow-up on the refund/credit because it can take 90 days or more to process right now with all the volume of bookings the cruise lines are dealing with.Many of my clients moved their bookings to sailing dates next year or into 2022, which means I do have some prospects of being paid next year when those trips sail, but it does me little good right now. A few cruise lines have started up again, with mixed results, but there is one I would like to point out. MSC Cruises is an Italian Owned company and one of their ships set sail recently, with Safety and Health guidelines in place on the ship and coordinated with the shore excursion tour partners. One family was denied boarding in the middle of the cruise because they did not follow the shore excursion tour operators guidelines, one of which was staying with the group so they could confirm no one had contact outside of their controlled tour. The tour operator told the ship, and the ship acted in accordance with the consequences they set out for the rules and guidelines they adopted for the resumption of cruising. I will refer to this incidence in my comments attached:",,,

CDC-2020-0087-3451,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Chantal,Hunt,"Comment from Hunt, Chantal","8. What plans should cruise ship operators have for operationalizing shoreside quarantine facilities in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak on board a ship, without exposing the public and without relying on Federal, State, or local resources?First off, we need to define “outbreak on board a ship”.  One or two cases shouldn’t constitute an “outbreak”.  I was on a ship March 8-14, 2020.  Nobody on that cruise tested positive on board or in the 14 days after.  The ship had already instituted much more stringent hand sanitization, crew handing out the food in the buffet (instead of passengers getting their own), etc.  They took temperatures prior to boarding, and had a Covid-related health questionnaire.  To be perfectly honest, I was not afraid of the virus until AFTER I returned from the voyage and saw the way people were behaving about it on land.   But I digress.  Please define “outbreak”.  Then, allow the cruise operators to provide their plans for mitigation and quarantine should a defined outbreak occur.They need to think outside the box.  For example, some colleges may be closed due to the outbreak.  Perhaps a private college would be willing to lease a dormitory and food service to a cruise line to use for the quarantine.  Or, since they have ships not currently in service, perhaps those could be used for quarantines?  Sort of like ships were used for Katrina Hurricane relief.9. Due to obstacles with commercial travel thus far, what pre-arrangements should cruise ship operators make with the airline industry to accept crew and passengers from ships not affected by COVID-19?Airlines should accept crew and passengers from ships not affected by Covid-19 just like any other passengers.  Do they currently prohibit any other population?  Are assisted living residents (for example) from Miami denied passage by any airlines?10. How should cruise ship operators address specific country travel restrictions that emerge as COVID-19 activity increases in geographical areas, such asa. border closures preventing passengers and crew from repatriating?I honestly think the first wave of cruises should be limited to passengers from countries willing to repatriate them regardless of whether they have been on a cruise or not.  Right now, I believe US citizens only should be allowed to embark on cruises leaving out of US homeports.  As for crew, that is a whole different situation.  At this point, new cruises will require new crews, so they would all be at the beginning of their contracts (theoretically) and wouldn’t need to be repatriated in the first 6 months after sailings resume.    b. seaport closures preventing porting of ships?This happens all the time during hurricanes and such (e.g., fog in Galveston).  Modify SOPs for inclement weather to also apply to COVID-19 related closures.  We are probably beyond the point in the pandemic that a US seaport which has allowed cruises to resume will then close its port to the returning passengers.c. embarking passengers originating from countries with heightened COVID-19 activity?In the case of US-homeported ships, the US has currently heightened activity on any given day in different regions, coupled with much lower hospitalizations, intensive care need, and deaths.  The CDC and cruise operators should limit passenger embarkations to the country where the ship embarks—US citizens or residents only at first.  Maybe an exception for Canadian nationals.11. What measures should cruise ship operators be required to take to reduce the burden on U.S. government resources if foreign seaports deny cruise ships the ability to come into port during a voyage?Initially, limiting voyages to nearby ports such as Bahamas, US ports or territories, or “cruise to nowhere” should eliminate this possibility. 12. Given difficulties cruise ship operators have experienced when repatriating crew via non-commercial transportation, what preparations should the industry make to repatriate passengers or crew via non-commercial transportation after COVID-19 is identified on board?Given the decrease in commercial travel demand, could not the cruise operators contract with commercial airlines to provide these services, with unused planes and furloughed flight crews, this could be a win-win, right?13. What innovations should cruise ship operators develop to reduce transmission of COVID-19 on board ships and how would these innovations be effective?State of the art air cleaning machines.  I believe many large casinos have invested in these.  Reservations only for shows (similar to how Royal Caribbean already does these on their Oasis class ships); then blocking off tables or seats in the venue.  Maybe using UV light to disinfect areas on a scheduled basis (e.g., public restrooms, cabins).",,,

CDC-2020-0087-3420,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,J,McGlaun,Comment from (name),"This response is from J McGlaun and K Zipf. We completed 48 cruises throughout the world in the last eleven years. The cruise ships held approximately 2,000 passengers and 1,000 crew. We will resume traveling when we believe that we, the crew and the local population we contact are safe through the entire trip. This includes the flights, hotel, dining, cruise, land transportation, excursions, etc. We do not want to spread diseases to the hard-working staff or the wonderful people that we meet. We do not want to get sick.We will resume cruising when we believe the cruise will not be ruined by a small number of people. For example, the cruise is NOT cancelled and all passengers are NOT quarantined when only a small number of cases occur. A few cases among three thousand people should not end the cruise and result in three thousand people being quarantined.We encourage the CDC to employ practices used in other businesses, e.g. airline, bus, car rental, hotel, restaurant, and entertainment. Passengers and crew will better understand and follow these practices. The cruise lines will have a stronger foundation for employing procedures used in similar businesses. The best practices will be ineffective if the cruise lines do not enforce them or the passengers/crew dont follow them.The first goal of our responses is to prevent SARS-CoV-2 from boarding the ship. The second goal is to prevent its spread if it does board. Sadly, people with COVID-19 will desire to board the ship. If aboard, they will spread SARS-CoV-2 unless transmission precautions are used. The following is a collection of suggestions based on our cruising experience. We hope our suggestions will be useful when the CDC and cruise operators develop a comprehensive plan.  We encourage the CDC to impose the minimum amount of restrictions necessary to safely resume cruises. We encourage the CDC to monitor cruises and modify restrictions to maintain safety. We hope that most restrictions will be unnecessary once a vaccination is distributed. Cruising is a wonderful way to see the world, learn about other cultures and meet wonderful people. We desire to resume cruising soon. Everyone wants a safe cruise.Our responses to the questions are in the attached pdf document ResponseTo2020-15812.pdf. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to respond.",,,
CDC-2020-0087-3408,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Travis,Kirby,Comment from (name),"With testing done prior to boarding and upon debarking, cruise ship passengers would be safer and more aware of their Covid status than any of the 20 million people a day filing through Walmart. Cruise lines have already voluntarily reduced capacity thus creating empty rooms to house those who are suspected of being sick and can be isolated from spreading. The Diamond Princess that is used as a fear campaign to justify a cruise ban shows us that thousands showing up sick at port simply doesn't happen and is just a scare tactic. The Diamond Princess had systematic Covid spreaders from China board and sailed for 2 weeks with no Covid or pandemic protocols in place. All onboard were not told of an outbreak until day 14 of their cruise. Even with 2 weeks of rampant unchecked Covid spreading, still 4 out of 5 people did not catch Covid. So the myth of thousands showing up sick at port is simply not true as proven by the Diamond Princess. Also, with public awareness, masks, health checks prior to boarding, rapid tests, reduced capacity and Covid protocols in place, cruise ships today would be safer and a Diamond Princess could not happen again. Up to 70,000 Americans a day are currently testing Covid positive even with no cruising. The true Covid spreaders are the land based business and not the cruise ships. It makes no sense that during the largest pandemic in the history of the CDC the only action taken by the CDC against any industry on the planet has been only the cruise industry. If there really was a war on Covid, then where is the CDC mask requirement on airlines which is FAA/Fed jurisdiction thus being CDC jurisdiction. So far airlines only have an internal mask policy only meaning that if someone doesn't follow the policy the airline does not have the weight of a fed regulation or rule behind them so all they can do to offenders is put them on the airlines internal no fly list. From March to May there was no airline mask policy either, so the CDC could have stepped in during the shutdown and required masks in fed ports of entries (airports) and in airplanes (FAA) but did nothing when it could of made a difference and only focus on their cruise ban. With rapid testing, reduced capacity, masks, Covid protocols and public awareness, I would feel safer on a cruise ship than being in my local Walmart full of people who have had no health screenings and do not know their Covid status. Please release the cruise ships and start focusing on the true Covid spreading industries, the land based ones. A cruise ban is not the answer to your problems and you cannot keep pointing to that as the sole accomplishment of the CDC during the largest pandemic in our lifetimes. Release the cruise ships and stop surrendering to Covid. ",,,
CDC-2020-0087-3427,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Anthony,Wilkins,"Comment from Wilkins, Anthony","I understand these comments are based on post Covid-19 occurrences, however I think the evaluation would be better served and publicly accepted if we look at future changes as best practices to avoid or reduce exposure and spread of ALL virus and illnesses. As a frequent cruiser, I think back to the days of Norovirus cruise adventures. As we embarked we would know we were rolling the dice with the laughable ""self-check"" preventive measures and the associated risk level. Being of good health and knowledgeable of good preventive practices, I was willing to accept the associated risks. I feel the same opportunity exist today, however the governmental proclamation of a pandemic has moved this to a whole new level. You do know know what you know until you know it and we can now see that this is not the deadly pandemic that was once promoted. When you are in good health, the risk for death or spread in no more than other viruses. I would have to say, I am quite disappointed that the CDC has been slow moving in getting to the point we are today. This delay has not only financial effects on the cruise industry and supporting infrastructure, but more so the mental well being of our citizens with the lock down mentality. A quick reversal and return to freedom to movement will save more lives and livelihoods than any fully effective vaccine that may ever be presented. So I think there are some changes that need to be implement to shore up cruising, that should have been done years ago. Focus on proven past science and not so much current trials and speculations. Unproven vaccines and testing will not be the cornerstone. The self identified European Cruise precaution efforts ongoing on existing cruises (MSC) are proving to be effective: staff evaluation, pre-cruise hold periods, testing and if needed isolation. Again, ALL illnesses not just Covid-19. So as a future cruiser sanding by for the green light, what am I looking for as good changes? 1. A legitimate screening before boarding ( temps and perhaps a 15 minute test card for multiple viruses. 2. Quality air ventilation on board. 3. Continual effective on board cleaning and preventive measures to avoid repeat contact surfaces ex door handles. 4. Elimination of self serve buffet food courts 5. Real time illness data of cruisers and perhaps increased preventive measures if rate increases ( shut down port stops / excursions )- ie keeps people inventive to be self-accountable for actions. 6. Offer safe-zones for cruisers that may be more at risk. That may include different sit down dining option hours. 7. Perhaps the cruise industry may require an additional fee or surcharge or insurance coverage for medical emergencies. Have pre-set agreements with ports, hotels, bus, train and airlines. 8. End the packing in of pre-sail muster drill and do a virtual televised event where you call in your code as confirmation watched the program. 9. Have on board easily identifiable medical staff to observe and council passengers on best practices and keep score of personal violations, up to and including removal from sailing. 10. Odd / even cabin number cruise line staff implemented in person mandatory screening every other day of sailing by appointment. 11. Extended days of sailing. At least 7 days. 12. Reasonably commercially priced cruise line only pre-planned excursions with monitoring staff to follow and observe. 13. Test all before disembark and have certification for customs. 14. Offer post cruise daily cruise line notifications for 20 days on any passenger illness reports.  Time is of the essence so please quickly work with the industry to work out common sense solutions that the general public can be sold as effective and reasonable measures to get back to sailing and living the life of a free american.",,,

What is the feasibility of conducting COVID-19 diagnostic testing using FDA-approved or authorized laboratory tests on board a cruise ship?I would think the antigen tests could be feasible on reduced-capacity trial runs at first.  I’m talking about the quick ones that aren’t very accurate.  They are accurate enough to catch most cases and then upon repeat testing, would catch most they may have missed.a. Should specimens be tested on board or should specimens be collected on board for commercial testing onshore?On board.b. How frequently should cruise ship operators test all passengers and crew?Prior to boarding (boarding day), once or twice during voyage (once for trips up to 5 nights and twice for 6-8 nights), and on the last day.  They could run the tests overnight and place a notice under the door by like 5:30 AM if positive results are found, so that passengers may then quarantine. c. What would be the anticipated financial cost of testing all passengers and crew?I do not know.  I’ve heard of a $5 rapid test.  However, they could do sample-pooling to reduce costs.  Test by cabin location, and then only run individual samples if a group of cabins’ pooled sample tests positive.  Perhaps initial voyages could be made up of passengers willing to cruise as a research study to see what works and what doesn’t.  They would give informed consent.5. Because reports of illness may lead to restrictions on crew activities, how should cruise ship operators encourage crew members to report mild symptoms of COVID-like illness to medical personnel?Same way we are doing on land.  Don’t come to work if you are sick.  Reward co-workers who step-up in their peer’s absence.  This may require a culture change from an HR perspective, aboard ships.a. How should cruise ship operators encourage medical personnel to report these cases to CDC?100% compliance.  Medical personnel are accustomed to government reporting.  It is the cruise lines that need to understand that this is non-negotiable. 6. What should be the medical capacity to manage an outbreak or a severe case of COVID-19 on board the ship?Cruise lines should be prepared to isolate those found to have the virus while on board, and to treat those who become ill enough to require “hospitalization” while on board, until those individuals can be returned to the point of origin (either by staying on board the remainder of the voyage or by other means such as airlift, if loss of life is expected from delay of land-based ICU treatment, for example).  A lot more is known about treating this virus now than in the beginning, and what the signs of imminent decline are.  As we now know, very few people actually end up in ICU, and they usually meet more than one risk-factor for poor outcomes.a. What arrangements should cruise ship operators have with private companies to transport and obtain medical care shoreside for passengers and crew with severe COVID-19?Cruise lines should be prepared to bring passengers or crew back to the US by means such as airlift, if loss of life is expected from delay of land-based ICU treatment.  For this reason, I feel that the initial voyages should be to nearby ports of call, such as the Bahamas, Key West, Jamaica, or to Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, or other US territories, etc.  The US should consider temporarily allowing “cruises to nowhere” or those that do not visit foreign ports during the pandemic.  There are cruisers who would welcome a short (3-4 night) cruise with no stops, if it would mean cruising is allowed again.  Or, this could be lifted as part of the trial-run of cruises from the US, which could also be part of a study of practices and outcomes which some passengers would be willing to give informed consent to be a part of (Including myself—an RN—I get it).  Ships could require “Covid insurance” at a nominal fee.  Maybe require passengers to have (government or private) health insurance coverage as a condition of boarding.7. What pre-arrangements should be made to ensure that all U.S. seaport communities will accept a returning ship after a COVID-19 outbreak is identified?  The CDC and cruise lines should work closely with the local governments of their homeports to make this happen.  If the home port is not willing to repatriate and allow the cruise lines to lease shoreside quarantine facilities, then cruises obviously cannot leave from that port.  They need to weigh their need for cruise-related commerce vs. fear of outbreak.  Again, we know a lot more about this virus, and our hospitals are currently not overrun, so this should not be an issue.",,,

We were very well taken care of by Carnival, the ship was constantly being cleaned everywhere we went and we were not allowed into any dining facilities without using hand sanitizer. At our last stop in Guatemala, we were not allowed to step foot on land until they took our temperatures. I did not feel upset or imposed upon at all. I think it's a very practical and logical thing to do. Take everyone's temperature!!!20. Should cruise ship operatorsrestrict the number of persons per room(e.g., maximum capacity of 2 adults percabin)?WHY WOULD THAT BE NECESSARY?

If amusement parks are open, then cruises should be able to sail. 2. The requirements should be the same for all cruise lines and similar to what protocol the amusement parks had to follow in order to reopen. 3.  Surely since beginning of April all personnel at all levels of any cruise line should have been trained on the appropriate way to prevent and identify how COVID -19 is spread. 4. All cruise ships have a medical center and should be equipped with the appropriate tests, and have enough tests for approximately 2/3 of the passengers.   Also, have appropriately trained staff to administer the test(s).a. Both, onboard if at sea and onshore when in port. b. Staff and crew should only be tested if exhibiting signs OR been exposed to someone.c. The cost should be paid but the person being tested and let them submit to their insurance for processing. 5.  Cruise personnel should be trained to identify and report signs of COVID-19 and the staff or passenger tested accordingly. 6. The medical capacity to handle a small outbreak should be equivalent to the requirements of a small town.     a.  Since ships typically are in the same ports frequently then either prepurchased medical should be stored there or arranged to be provided. 7.  Anyone who has tested positive has been properly quarantined, and they are disembarked last with stringent protocol.8. In the event of an onboard break out all the people affected should be quarrantined appropriately, and then disembarked last at then end of the cruise, with stringent protocol. 9. Have screening and a separating embarkation area. 10.  Adhere to the travel restrictions already implemented in the country in which the staff or passengers is traveling from.  If there are restrictions or a travel ban, then they should not be accepted. 11. All cruise ships should be able to return to the port in which they departed regardless of outbreak. 12. Quarantine them until they are able to make the appropriate arrangements.13.  Hand sanitizing stations, assigned dining tables/times, sanitation of all common areas frequently throughout the day,  Shows, games, events should have limited capacities to promote social distancing. 14.  Yes cruise ships should implement what is required but the CDC and greater if needed. 15.  Other virus's have been contracted on cruises previously so I am sure most staff are trained in the appropriateprotocol on how to handle. 16, They should do whatever they can in their power to prevent introduction on ships.   a. Yes  b. Yes  c.  temperature and visual physical appearance  d.  Possibly if they show signs  e.  Isolate them and disembark.  f.  No testing but definitely screening  g.  Yes but keep them quarrantined until they have returned to their point of origin.  17.  That is an option    a.  reduce it to a figure that is still viable to their business model   b.  reduction should not impede the cruise line's ability to be profitable.    c.  No no further exploratory capacity testing should be performed by the cruise line to determine the spread rate at reduction of personnel and passengers. 18.  No    a.  I do not believe it will   b.

CDC-2020-0087-3437,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Anonymous,Anonymous,Comment from (name),"My business relies solely on the inter-island cruise ship Norwegian Pride of America in Hawaii.  During this no-sail order and the state of Hawaii in lock down, by business has seen no revenues since March.  This remains true for the majority of businesses in Hawaii with links to the cruise ship industry.  Hawaii Golf Cruises LLC books golf arrangements for golfers onboard primarily the Pride of America and sometimes organizes packages that includes the cruise plus golf.  Business pre-COVID-19 was steady and on a growth pattern.  Hawaii Golf Cruises LLC is ready to take the necessary protocols to ensure the safety of all guests that book with Hawaii Golf Cruises LLC.  Based on my long standing personal knowledge of working onboard cruise ships, the personnel onboard always operate with the highest levels of sanitation and hygiene.  I have the upmost confidence the Pride of America and other cruise ships visiting Hawaiian waters will uphold a high level of respect for all crew, guests onboard and the residents of Hawaii.Time is of the essence.  If the No Sail Order exists for several months to come, there will be very few cruise ship operators left to service the ship's guests.  This has a compounding effect on local livelihoods and tax collecting by the state.

CDC-2020-0087-3449,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Chantal,Hunt,"Comment from Hunt, Chantal","Planning and Infrastructure1. Given the challenges of eliminating COVID-19 on board cruise ships while operating with reduced crew on board during the period of the April 15, 2020 No Sail Order Extension, what methods, strategies, and practices should cruise ship operators implement to prevent COVID-19 transmission when operating with passengers?As a Registered Nurse who is a frequent cruiser, I feel that completely eliminating COVID-19 on cruise ships is neither possible nor necessary.  It is the reaction to infections that needs to be addressed. Eliminating COVID-19 would be like eliminating norovirus or influenza in this environment—nearly impossible.  However, I do feel that cruise lines should be prepared to isolate those found to have the virus while on board, and to treat those who become ill enough to require “hospitalization” while on board, until those individuals can be returned to the point of origin (either by staying on board the remainder of the voyage or by other means such as airlift, if loss of life is expected from delay of land-based ICU treatment, for example).In addition, I feel that the following measures should be undertaken during at least the initial period of cruise resumption:•Temperature checks of all passengers and crew prior to boarding, and daily via thermal imaging or other touch-free method.  This could be done at the embarkation port (like they did at Port Everglades the week of March 8, when I boarded one of the last ships allowed to sail), and in high-traffic areas such as entrances to dining establishments.•Decrease Staff and passengers by 50% to better allow for social distancing.•Institute more times for set dining and for entertainment/shows, thereby further allowing social distancing among guests and crew.  For example, have 3 dining times for dinner, rather than 2, and assign by lottery, fully making this clear in the booking documents or some other place.  Tables can only be combined when members of the same immediate family or Covid-pod of people are sailing together, and then no more than 8 to a table, thereby allowing 10  total people in that general area (the 8 guests and two servers).  Servers are masked at all times.  Passengers only until food is served.•Make the corridors one-way, unless a certain corridor has a blind end.  They are usually a circle, so this should be possible to some extent.•Make the elevators one way, and limit to those with disabilities and for those traveling up more than 2 or down more than 3 floors.  Again, these rules would need to be given to passengers at the time of booking, or at the time of printing the boarding passes.  •Require masks in all indoor spaces where social distancing is not possible, or where more than 10 individuals will be in the space at a time.  So basically everywhere, except while seated for dining.•Casino: Temporarily disallow smoking.  Masks worn at all times unless currently drinking a beverage; Add multiple hand sanitizer stations and containers of disinfecting wipes for patrons to use to clean their machines prior to playing.  Offer an additional outdoor smoking area nearby the casino, where one doesn’t already exist.•In addition to temperature scanning, Cruise line is responsible to obtain and administer rapid antigen tests upon boarding, once or twice during the voyage (depending how long), and once the last day.  Passengers must agree to this prior to booking and/or prior to boarding.•Do not house any passengers in inside cabins until the pandemic is over.  This is assuming the CDC/USA intends to quarantine passengers on ships like happened in the beginning (which I do not recommend—there is already widespread community transmission in the US, so quarantining people aboard ships seems excessive at this point).•Each stateroom should be separated by one empty stateroom on each side and directly across the hall.•Stateroom attendants should wear PPE and change gloves gowns and shoe coverings between rooms.•Provide a sizable portion of the ship for possible quarantine.  Perhaps the lower three levels of staterooms, at first.2. How should cruise ship operators bolster their internal public health programs with public health experts and invest in a robust public health infrastructure to ensure compliance with measures to detect, prevent, and control the spread of COVID-19?Inform passengers at booking or when checking in online about whatever new rules will be enforced.  Make it part of the ticket contract.  Enforce by future no-sail lists maybe (kind of like airlines do when people break safety-related rules?).  Or enforce by possible mandatory quarantine to cabin or brig for flagrant disregard for safety measures (like they would do for any other such behavior pre-Covid). Most people like me are willing to give it a try and follow strict guidelines to be able to sail again.  Honesty, I would feel safer on a ship than I do at my rural Walmart.",,,

Should cruise ship operators implement other interventions to decrease or prevent the spread of COVID-19 on board ships?Yes.  As many interventions as possible to prevent the spread.  I have mentioned many ideas already in the above questions.15. What evidence of efficacy or other rationale exists for any public health interventions that cruise ship operators propose to take on board ships?Here are a few examples:Requiring masks: (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32232986/)Social Distancing: (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32213329/)UV Light: (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32581288/)Resumption of Passenger Operations16. What steps should cruise ship operators take to prevent the introduction of COVID-19 onto ships after resuming passenger operations?•Temperature checks of all passengers and crew prior to boarding, and daily via thermal imaging or other touch-free method.  This could be done at the embarkation port (like they did at Port Everglades the week of March 8, when I boarded one of the last ships allowed to sail), and in high-traffic areas such as entrances to dining establishments.•Rapid testing prior to boarding.•Decrease Staff and passengers by 50% to better allow for social distancing.•Cruise line is responsible to obtain and administer rapid antigen tests upon boarding, once or twice during the voyage (depending how long), and once the last day.  •The CDC and cruise operators should limit passenger embarkations to the country where the ship embarks—US citizens or residents only at first.  Maybe an exception for Canadian nationals.•Initially, limiting voyages to nearby ports such as Bahamas, US ports or territories, or “cruise to nowhere” could reduce risk of the virus being brought on board.•Organized, smaller excursions only.  No passenger-directed outside activities at ports.a. Should cruise ship operators deny boarding to passengers with COVID-like illness or confirmed infection with COVID-19?Yes.b. Should cruise ship operators deny boarding to passengers with known exposure to a person with COVID-19 during the previous 14 days?Yes (or 10 days, which I believe is the new recommended length of quarantine).c. What methods should cruise ship operators use to screen for exposures and detect COVID-like illness in passengers seeking to board the ship?As mentioned above-temperature taking and thermal scanners at embarkation and regularly thereafter at a minimum.  The rapid POC tests where samples can be pooled would also be good.d. Should cruise ship operators deny boarding to passengers coming from COVID-19 high-incidence geographic areas?I think this depends on the definition of “high-incidence areas” and whether the passenger admits to high-risk behaviors (although I don’t know how you could prove that one way or another).  Again, I feel US-porting shops should limit passengers to US residents, for the time being.e. How should cruise ship operators manage embarking crew with COVID-like illness, known exposure, or coming from high-incidence geographic areas after resuming passenger operations?NO embarkation of anyone with known symptoms or exposure, but high-incidence geographic regions—quarantine staff in a controlled setting such as a leased hotel or dormitory (with proper quarantine measures in place during that time) for 10 days prior to allowing them to board.f. Should cruise ship operators test passengers and crew pre-boarding? If yes, what should the testing protocol be?Yes.  Spread out the embarkation day process and test everyone using rapid tests prior to boarding.  Deny boarding to individuals who test positive and anyone accompanying them.  May also need to require a positive test that passengers obtain within a set time before embarkation day (assuming testing with quick results becomes more available by the time cruises are allowed to resume).g. Should cruise ship operators transport and house passengers and crew denied boarding at the seaport to avoid exposing the public?Given the decrease in commercial travel demand, could not the cruise operators contract with commercial airlines to provide these services, with unused planes and furloughed flight crews, this could be a win-win, right?  This would need to occur after a 10-day quarantine, which could be done at a leased hotel or other such setting, with food service and medical surveillance provided.",,,

I think CLIA and the cruise industry need to have a prolonged campaign telling the public about all of the changes they are making to ensure more health safety on board such as reduced capacity, changing the buffet method of food delivery, medical checks on all passengers before boarding and limiting shore excursions to only the one approved by the cruise line, to name a few.  The public needs to be reassured that it will be safe to go on a cruise.  ",,,

Room stewards should not come into the rooms.4Testing should be done on shore right before you enter the boat, and additional tests done on the boat if people have symptoms.  Staff should be tested before passengers come on, and when we leave. Costs of the tests, part should be covered by the passenger 5-6Where ever the cruise leaves and returns to, they need to work with that govt entity,  Encourage crew to come forward with mild symptoms and that if they do get sick, they are able to still get paid while they recover.  Medical Capacity should be larger, use house keeping staffCruise companies should have relationships with medical staff at all ports so that if there is an issue, they already have a connection to a hospital or care facility 7Cruises need to work with governors in the cities that they leave so that as part of the pre-departure so that they can show the governor the changes they are doing, are following the CDC guidelines and get sign off on being able to return to port and disembark with covid cases or no covid cases8They can have a mobile shoreside small hospital with respirators and supplies 9Many airlines already have strict rules and have banned people, I think the cruise line should do the same. 10Communication is key.  If they are going to sail somewhere, they need to have upfront all of the proper approvals and the locations need to know what parts of the world the people are coming from. Embarking passengers with heightened covid-19 activity will still need to embark and go home and be safe, local government is there to assist with countries or states whose numbers have heightened. 11Cruise ships should be required to make sure they have prior written or whatever approval to dock at the port and let people off.  Ports who deny should be fined if we already have approval and they say no12They should work with hotels and other non-commercial transportation so that their staff can be somewhere safe while waiting to go home. Plus having communications with govt officials for those countries should be in place 13-15Heightened cleaning, spaced out tables, waivers that need to be signed, rapid testing before being allowed on boat, limited guests on ship, limited activities, mask wearing requirement16Rapid testing done day of, 5 min test.   Boarding is denied if you have covid like illness or are infected.    Crew with covid or symptoms should be taken directly to the seashore makeshift hospital they created. Cruises should transport and house crew for free. Passengers, who were denied, the cruise line can help them to get care17Crew and passengers should be at lower capacity,50%. Passenger capacity should be limited for as long as the state/country they leave out of has their rules about limited capacity. Having some people is better than no people economically.  They should not have to provide scientific evidence 18The voyages should not have to be shortened.   I dont think decreasing the trip help the spread of transmission, because if that were true then the cruise lines would be able to do 3-5-day cruises already.  Cruise lines should not need to provide scientific evidence.19Shore excursions need to be limited and strictly guarded. Passengers and crew who break rules while on port will be denied boarding.20Operators should limit to how many people can fit into the room21There are a lot of free mental health resources out there22Disembark should be spaced out, everyone take their own luggage off.23Yes, cancel, do a deep cleaning and resume after a week or two.24Refund passengers if they are denied boarding. Refund if all of a sudden, my area started becoming a high incidence area. They should already know where I am coming from when I signed up.  Refund last minute due to covid concerns, like they were diagnosed or near someone in 14 days.25There should be something like a medical insurance fee you have to pay, before you get on.  Also, if you dont feel well and dont report you, you can be fined and be placed on the not able to cruise list.26Embarkation and Disembarkation should be at different time slots.   Safety drills and training will have to be in smaller groups. Dining times set with less tables, less people at the large tables. Entertainment- less seating and possibly reservations. Shore excursions need to be in small protected groups27Better government relationships, business relationships and communities when you make rules and enforce them for the safety of your crew and passengers28Only if this is the same for airlines and trains.",,,

What benefits can be expected in terms of averted deaths and illnesses and how does this compare to the expected financial costs of the above measures?Since I am a passenger in a medical field, I can only speak to my opinion of this from that perspective (I do not know anything about expected financial costs).  If all the above measures are instituted and followed, we should be able to avoid excess cruise-related illness and deaths from Covid-19. We cannot stop cruising forever.  The cruise lines can only not operate for so long without putting the industry out of business. It is time to get the plans put in place and start bringing crews back (allowing time for training and quarantine) to a limited number of ships, so that passengers may start taking cruises again ASAP.  It has been almost 6 months already.  The only way to move forward is to move forward.28. Should cruise ship operators be required to designate a responsible company official who will accept legal responsibility for failure to implement measures to protect public health?Yes, but define “failure to implement measures to protect public health”.  If passengers are negligent, how should the cruise operators be held responsible?  I am not a lawyer.  However, all companies should have such a person or group of persons.",,,

I believe cruise ship operators have learned enough from past experience to determine appropriate strategies and procedures to implement. While they are in business to make money, they have a vested interest in protecting their clients and crew.4. It should be feasible to conduct testing onboard. But it should only be mandatory in cases of suspected infection.4a. The cost would probably prohibit onboard equipment. But specimens should be tested at the terminals.4b. Passengers should not be tested as a matter of course. Crew members should be tested monthly.6. A ship should be able to manage caring for the medical needs of four people at a time with an area (with sleeping and other necessities) large enough to accommodate one percent of its population available to quarantine cases.13 & 14. Cruise lines are sufficiently able to develop necessary innovations without my advice or maybe without CDC’s advice.16 a. Passengers with confirmed infection of COVID-19 should be denied boarding, but passengers with simply mild illness should not be denied.16 b. None exposure should not disqualify a passenger from boarding unless he/she exhibits COVID-like illnesses.16 c. Temperature checks should be sufficient screening. Passengers with high temperatures should be evaluated by medical personnel and possibly tested for COVID-19.16 d. Persons from high-incidence geographic areas should not be denied boarding unless they exhibit COVID-like illnesses.16 f. Crew should be tested before they start working a new contract and monthly thereafter. Passengers should not be tested pre-boarding as a matter of course.17. Ship operators should not be required to reduce passenger or crew loads any more than other U.S. businesses are.18. Length of cruises should be determined by the cruise lines. Shorter cruises have just as much risk as longer ones. 19. Shore excursions are an important issue. Anywhere COVID-19 is a problem, passengers should only participate in excursions that are cruise line approved.20. Cabin capacities should not be changed. If reducing passenger load is encouraged or enforced, it should be executed by limiting the number of staterooms occupied.23. Cruise lines should not cancel cruises because COVID-19 cases are identified. But potential passengers should be advised of any cases on specific ships and allowed to cancel for a full refund in desired.24. Cruise lines should provide full refund for any cabin where someone cancels because of COVID-like illness or concern. This policy should be discontinued when COVID-19 becomes a relatively minor issue.26. Let cruise ship operators determine the best way to deal with issues a-e.28.

For 29 years, APPis primary customers are directly and indirectly connected to the cruise line industry. As a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the CDC No Sail order to stop all cruise line operations, APPi has suffered devastating financial losses. APPi 2019 YTD vs 2020 YTD shows a decrease of 61% revenue (-$2,346,594). Our projections for the rest of 2020 continue to worsen as long as the CDC order No Sail order is in effect and APPi will most likely be forced out of business as a direct result. At the request of several of our Cruise Line partners, APPi developed a new Antimicrobial Protection coating that protects printed materials from dangerous microbes. This proactive and aggressive strategy toward reducing potential risk of these dangerous microbes is just one example of how dedicated the cruise line industry and APPi are toward safeguarding passengers. During the initial phases of the global pandemic, the cruise line industry was affected worse than other comparable travel sectors. Since the cruise line industry has far better health procedures in place, cases of the COVID-19 virus were identified onboard a couple ships and immediate quarantine measures were implemented. The optics of these procedures looked bad to the general public which certainly influenced the CDC No Sail order. Other travel sectors who were not conducting testing or extreme cleaning procedures as seen onboard cruise ships, were not ordered to stop their sectors. Airlines, Railway, Bus travel, etc., were allowed to continue operating even though those travel sectors were not conducting testing and therefore not reporting cases. The cruise line industry should not be penalized for being proactive to minimize exposure to and report cases due to the pandemic. At the very least, other travel sectors should be held to the high standards established by the cruise line industry. We strongly urge the CDC to end the No Sail order for the cruise line industry.

I think that this industry is being discriminated against and this needs to stop. Talk about petri dish, take a close look at a hospital or Dr office waiting room or how about a train. This ""no sail"" order needs to stop. Enough is enough. And don't get me started with the mask issue.I hope and pray that someone with some common sense starts making decisions regarding Cruise ships leaving out of the US Ports. One thing that can make a difference is limiting crews from going from a ship out of other Nations to working ships leaving US ports. Unless they are in quarantine for 14 days. Also, if there is a high risk Country not letting their people cruise from our ports without a quarantine period. Better yet, just stop with all this nonsense and let us cruise. You can not protect us from everything that is out there! Open up my Country now!   ",,,

I feel the cruise lines have gone above and beyond in what they will do to ensure safe cruising .  There are also tens of thousands of people here in the US whose livelyhoods depend on the cruise industry.I no doubt would feel safer on a cruise ship than on an airplane or subway yet those are open.ThanksFrank,,,
CDC-2020-0087-3485,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Anonymous,Anonymous,Comment from Anonymous,"As much as I would like to cruise now, there are several things I believe the CDC should consider before allowing cruising to resume:1.Travel insurance – Will it cover my medical expenses if I contract the virus (2020 my travel insurance did not cover anything relating to the Pandemic)?  Will the travel insurance cover health care on the ship, foreign or local hospital and medical transportation all related to the virus?2.Will a port accept a ship which has a passenger or passengers with the virus?  Will passengers be tested when returning to the ship from a port?  Will passengers who contract the virus in a foreign port be allowed to return to the ship?3.Will passengers be allowed back into their home country if they have the virus or if they contracted the virus during the cruise?4.Will all passengers be confined to their cabin if any passenger or crew comes down with the virus?  If so, how long will passengers be confined to their cabins?  5.How often will passengers and crew be tested for the virus?  Who pays for this?6.Cruising is socializing.  How can one socialize if you are 6 feet apart and wearing masks?  How will this affect elevator usage, embarking and disembarking, riding in tenders, participating in onboard activities, including shows in the theater and walking down narrow passenger hallways?  Will mask be mandatory at all times?  7.Who is going to monitor and control social distancing?8.Will local entertainment, local travel agents and other special guests be allowed onboard?9.How and who will enforce social distancing on side excursions (bus, groups, local attractions, luncheons, etc.)?10.How many ports will even accept cruise ships in the near future?  Cruising becomes very expensive just sitting on a ship for days and not going anywhere especially if you are confined to your cabin.11.Cruising in the United States ports – some states are asking for quarantine before entering their state.  How will that impact entering or leaving United States ports?These are just a few of my concerns.  Hopefully as an avid cruiser, these concerns will be worked out to our satisfaction and I can cruise again.",,,
CDC-2020-0087-3462,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Grace,Moore,"Comment from Moore, Grace","I am a 5 star with HAL.   I realize that the covid situation may make cruising questionable for both cruise lines and passengers.   I suggest that cruise lines work with insurance companies to develop a policy that will refund in full to passengers who 1) must cancel for any reason or maybe just for any reason related to covid 2) are denied boarding for any reason 3) are disembarked anywhere other than the final destination because of covid 19, including payment for quarantine and repatriation 4) confined to cabin prorated by number of days in quarantine 5) prorata for missed ports due specifically to covid 19 and 6) costs incurred to return home due to late arrival at end of cruise or cruise ending in some foreign port.This insurance should be mandatory (essentially added to the cruise price).   Essentially this would be a blanket charge to the cruise line for the cruise - and perhaps could be treated that way - the cruise would of course then have to cost more.   A ""cancel for ANY reason rider could be offered in addition at an extra charge.I realize that this makes the overall cost of the cruise increase for everyone, but it would protect the cruise line from lawsuits and give the passengers confidence to book.    Perhaps it would allow the cruise lines to survive - otherwise I have doubts that they will.Regarding the crew - It is impractical to offer everyone single cabins and since the crew interact with each other constantly and social distancing is impractical I think very frequent testing would be prudent as well as providing some ""isolation"" cabins.   Also, it might be possible to set up some facilities in frequently visited ports where crew that were infected could be disembarked, quarantined and treated.  I know this increases operating costs but it would be spread over all cruises.  There must also be some financial provision to treat infected crew - this is only humane and I don't think passengers should object to those costs being absorbed in total cruise fares.If the cruise industry is to survive, fares will have to adjust to the new normal.   Presuming the virus will someday get under control, I believe future passengers will welcome a little more ""peace of mind"" regarding risk of being thrown off the ship in some remote port and left to their own devices.   Essentially passengers should be ""required"" through higher fares to absorb the risks involved in venturing abroad.  One of the problems on most cruise ships is crowding.   Some passengers might prefer to cruise with half the passengers and half the crew at twice the price.   Not sure about this - but some would.   One demographic that might jump at the chance would be single seniors.    While I'm making suggestions - stop cutting into the public areas by taking away deck space for such things as cabanas and private chairs on the promenade deck!    More space for everyone?Thank you and good luck.    Grace Moore",,,

The employee's of the CDC are receiving their pay cheques every month so they don't care about the others and the impact this has on stopping the ships from sailing. Virus or no virus, vaccine or no vaccine sailing should start as all Cruise lines have a safe protocol and procedures in place. You guys are over exaggerating. Don't you see how somthly everything is going in Italy and Europe with the sailings?",,,

We believe the cruise industry must the health and safety of its crew and passengers and this subject to law suit in civil courts.  So the existing outdated laws must be changed so appropriate lawsuits may to hold the cruise lines responsible. We believe passengers and crew members must legally notarized  medical certificates that their shots and vaccines are current, including for the current flu and the social COVID-19 vaccinations before they can board the ship prior to sailing.  All rooms and public spaces must be sterilized it can be occupied.  HEPA filters must be used and cleaned in all occupied spaces.  Face masks should available for all and anyone coughing or sneezing must wear one at all times in public and perhaps require in room dining until medically cleared.Infrared thermometers must be used on all boarding the ship and passengers attending lectures and before dining. The list of 28 questions and the subsections of the questions will be answered by lawyers who want their legal rights protected so they can sue or be part of a class action lawsuit that we as non-lawyers can’t properly address.  With new public health safety measures are implemented we are looking forward to lengthy cruising again.",,,

Cruises in Italy and Germany are going well  with no incidents,  yet we can't sail on a cruise? What leg do you have to stand on to allow planes to fly at full capacity in such a  small cabin (plenty of opportunity for infection to occur) but not let us sail? Even the research shows that you are safer on a cruise ship than going to your local grocery store or strip club... I'd rather be safer in a  ""cruise bubble "" than being stuck on land. Why is  every other industry able to open up in phases, but not cruising? Why can't they even get a chance? With successful cruises restarting in other parts of the world how is it more dangerous on a cruise ship than going to a movie theater or sending my kids back to school?

CDC-2020-0087-3479,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,Paul,Kinzie,"Comment from Kinzie, Paul ","You have an extensive list of items to consider in restarting cruising.  I don’t know if i have the time or expertise to comment properly on each but will give some thoughts as outlined below.  Pre-cruise:1.  All passengers should provide results of covid taken within 30-40 days prior to embarkation.   2.  Passengers that had positive test results need to provide results of follow up test at 15-20 days prior to embarkation.3.  Passengers that continue to have positive test results must provide negataive test results prior to entering cruise terminal on embarkation day.  If notPossible they will be denied boarding.  These passengers have the option of canceling cruise plans prior to arriving at cruise terminal.4.  All passengers will need to pass through UV light stations and temperature check upon entering cruise terminal.  All baggage should pass throughUV light.5.  Passengers should be assigned a time slot to enter terminal.  Lines should be 6-10 apart, separated by a wall if possible. Lines single file people/families 6 Feet apart from next person/family.  Masks should be required for boarding except where identification is required.  6.  Line should essentially be continuous movement till reaching a cruise host who finishes the check in process.  Upon completion of checkin passengers Continue thru one of several paths available to board ship.  There is no waiting in a group area in cruise terminal.  7.  Passengers should not be allowed in cruise terminal until ship is ready to board.  Terminal should not be a holding area just a structure to facilitate the The separation of masses, basic uv cleanseing and processing of passengers for boarding the ship.  8.  The terminal should have a positive air flow with filtration to minimize virus transmission.  9.  Any passengers who do not pass the temperature or physical signs test for covid should be seperated out into a specific area for further assessment of    Health.  If temperature and other physical signs are determined not to be covid related, passenger can rejoin boarding process. On the ship:1.  There should be random placement of UV light stations around the ship.  Particularly in high traffic and public areas.  2.  Buffets should be completely shielded except for ship personnel who are doing the serving.  No passenger self serving.  Ship personnel serving shouldHave appropriate clothing, gloves, face shields, masks, etc.  to not expose food or passengers .   Passengers should be masked in buffet areas except to Eat or drink.  3.  Theater/stage shows should be scheduled more frequently (more times a day, more days) with smaller crowds.  Theater disinfected between shows.  4.  Random temperature checks around the ship.  Example:  everyone going into the dinning room or theater is checked.   Could be that a couple of theShips personell randomly travel round the lido deck and take temperatures.  5.  Limit number of people into casinos, stores, classes, etc.. 6.  Mandatory curfew for children and teenagers at night.7.  Possible mandatory curfew for adults at night.  Example:  no one outside of their cabin between 1:30am -5am so all public areas can be disinfected. 8.  No waiting in lounges, theaters, hallways, stairwells for disembarking for tours, leaving ship, etc..  Passengers should be called from their room to leave theShip.  9.  Initially the ships upon returning to cruising, should not use the inside cabins.  Only the rooms with verandahs and balconies should be used.  This for Fresh air, sunlight (natural UV) and to reduce number of people aboard.  ",,,

CDC-2020-0087-3549,2020-09-18T04:00:00Z,B,Sims,Comment from (name),"I understand that historically, there were outbreaks of Covid on cruise ships such as  with the Diamond Princess.  At the time of the outbreak, Jan 2020, little was known about Covid.   Outbreaks were starting to happen around the world.  This was a novel virus with lots of unknowns.   It is my understanding that the Princess cruise ships, Diamond Princess, Grand Princess, etc,  co-operated and followed WHO and other known guidelines.  Cruising was suspended for good reason.   In fact, as you know, lots of businesses were suspended including amusement parks, theaters, travel, schools and hotels, to name a few.   As the months have ticked by, every industry has resumed except the cruise lines.   As the industries have resumed, there have been trial and error with the health protocols.   I feel that cruise ships companies along with the employees and companies that provide support to the cruise industry have been penalized by the CDC.    The cruise industry needs to restart.  The livelihood of thousands of individuals and families are at stake. If land based businesses are allowed to open up,  then treat ALL industries the same and that goes for the cruise industry.   Cruise lines add to the US economy through jobs, tourist dollars, etc.   Cruise lines already have strict cleaning routines.   In fact, cruise ships are  cleaner than most business.  For instance, gas stations, public bathrooms and fast foot restaurants are disgusting, filthy, and down right unhygienic.  Crews on cruise can be found cleaning  24/7.  Cruise lines in Germany, Italy, France (to name a few) have been successful with returning to cruising.   The US should bring cruising back.  Start with 1- 2 ships and add additional ships every 2 weeks.    Specific thoughts:Food safety - crew to serve the foodRecreational water safety - limit number of people in pools Lounge chairs - space the chairs, sanitize after useTables - space them apartTesting - temp checks, Diagnostic testing - FDA approved quick test at time of getting onboardExcursions - sponsored by the cruise line The CDC has allowed airlines to return to flying.  Initially, airlines had to leave the middle seat open.   Not any more.   Airlines are packing people into the airplane.   CDC, how can this be ??   Do you really see this as a safe practice?  The problem with repatriating crew was the fault of the CDC. Do not blame the cruise line !Crew need to be able to use commercial transportation and treated just like any other passenger on an airplane.  CDC, ENOUGH  IS ENOUGH !!  In my opinion, cruise ships should be allowed to return to sailing with similar universal health protocols(hand washing, social distancing, and mask wearing) just as theme parks, airlines, hotels, schools, businesses, restaurants, etc have done.
